408c0206 IN ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM CONRAIL'S CASH RESERVES UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC OFFERING
408c0207 NOMURA'S U. S. OPERATION RELIES MAINLY ON THE STRENGTH OF ITS GOVERNMENT BOND TRADING AND SALES DIVISIONS
408c0208 NOMURA IS BELIEVED TO RANK AMONG THE TOP HALF OF THE FORTY PRIMARY DEALERS IN U. S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES

409c0204 WHAT TRIGGERED G. M.'S NEW STRATEGY ISN'T CLEAR
409c0205 WHILE G. M. APPARENTLY HAS DECIDED THAT ITS INCREASINGLY GENEROUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAD GOTTEN PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE CUTTING PRODUCTION IS COSTLY TOO
409c0206 THE HIGH FIXED COSTS OF IDLE FACILITIES SURELY WILL DEPRESS G. M.'S FIRST QUARTER PROFIT
409c020a THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES

409c020c LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION
409c020d ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE
409c020e ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS

460c0206 THEY ARE OFTEN KNOWN FOR A MAVERICK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND HIGH FEES

460c0208 WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST
460c0209 THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED
460c020a IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN
460c020b AFTER MUCH CONFLICT SECRETARY OF STATE CYRUS VANCE STRUCK A DEAL IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN
460c020c EACH EMBASSY COMPLEX HAD TO BE OCCUPIED SIMULTANEOUSLY
460c020d CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET UNION'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY WAS COMPLETED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BEFORE WORK ON THE U. S.'S NEW MOSCOW EMBASSY HAD EVEN STARTED
460c020e THE SOVIETS THEN PUSHED TO OCCUPY THEIR NEW SITE BUT THE U. S. RESISTED UNTIL ITS OWN BUILDINGS WERE READY
460c020f AS THE U. S. BUILDINGS WERE COMPLETED IN MOSCOW THE SOVIETS WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THEIR NEW FACILITIES ON MOUNT ALTO

460c020x ITS HEAVY DEBTS AND DEPRESSED ENERGY AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES MADE IT APPEAR IMMUNE TO RAIDERS

460c021a WE WOULDN'T HAVE ACQUIRED WEAREVER PROCTORSILEX IF THERE WEREN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD TO IT HE SAID
460c021b ELECTRIC APPLIANCES ARE THE LARGEST PART OF THAT BUSINESS HE SAID
460c021c <NOISE> TODAY THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY IS ON THE ROPES WITH SALES PLUMMETING NINETY SEVEN PERCENT IN A SINGLE YEAR
460c021d THIS ILLUSTRATES THE SAD TRUTH THAT THINGS CAN CHANGE OVERNIGHT IN THE STOCK MARKET

460c0301 LAST YEAR SPONSORS OF A STRONG ACID RAIN BILL CLAIMED TO HAVE A TENTATIVE ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE COMMITTEE IN FAVOR OF THEIR BILL

460c0312 FOLLOWING THE REORGANIZATION MR. LICHTEN BECAME EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR TAX RELATED FINANCINGS AND FOREIGN CORPORATE CLIENTS
460c0313 THE FED'S POSTURE THROUGH ALL OF THIS IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE WILLIAM MCCHESNEY MARTIN FED OF THE MID NINETEEN FIFTIES
460c0314 <NOISE> THERE WAS NEVER ANY QUESTION ABOUT MR. MARTIN'S PRIORITIES HE WAS FIRST OF ALL AN INFLATION FIGHTER AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY TO THE GOOD
460c0315 BUT NO ONE WAS EVER SURE JUST HOW THE FED WOULD WAGE ITS INFLATION BATTLES
460c0316 MR. MARTIN INDICATED HE WOULD LEAN AGAINST THE WIND WHEN HE SENSED INFLATION COMING AND IT DID
460c0317 HE GOT RID OF THE INFLATION SURGE THAT BEGAN IN NINETEEN FIFTY SIX BUT IT TOOK THE DEEP NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT RECESSION TO DO SO

460c0407 IF ALL OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED MR. WILLIAMS WOULD HOLD NINE POINT FOUR TWO PERCENT INTEREST IN THE COMPANY
460c040b TO CHANGE SUCH THINKING FORD HAS RECENTLY BEGUN CIRCULATING NEW SALARY GUIDELINES
460c040c WE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE STAFF IN CONSIDERING SALARIES SAYS MR. HAUSMAN

460c0413 SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH OLDER OR LARGER BUSINESSES THINK GEORGE BUSH'S POLICY WOULD BE THE MOST FAVORABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESS

461c0211 THE PROCEEDINGS ARE THE LAST CHANCE TO BRING MILITARY MEN TO CIVILIAN JUSTICE
461c0212 SO FAR IN FOUR YEARS OF CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT SEVEN TOP MILITARY OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONVICTED
461c0213 CHARGES WERE BROUGHT AGAINST HUNDREDS OF OTHERS BUT PROSECUTIONS WERE HALTED LAST YEAR IN THE FACE OF ARMY RESTIVENESS

461c0307 FOR RIVAL EASTERN AIRLINES A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION IT MAY BE YET ANOTHER LOSS OF PRESTIGE
461c030c I THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT
461c030d HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY SERIOUS THOUGHT TO DIVERSIFYING
461c030e MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO
461c030f OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING
461c030g YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY
461c030k I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
461c030l EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
461c030m NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
461c030n CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
461c030o WE NEED A NEW NATIONAL POLICY ON THE ROLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SHOULD PLAY IN OUR SOCIETY
461c030p OUR CURRENT POLICY IS STILL BASED ON THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR FRAMED WHEN THE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER WAS STILL A DREAM
461c030q THE ACT PROVIDED THE IMPETUS FOR ACHIEVING THE OVERRIDING TELECOMMUNICATIONS OBJECTIVE OF THAT TIME UNIVERSAL SERVICE
461c030r BUT THIS OBJECTIVE HAS FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES BEEN FULFILLED
461c030s WITH NO NEW OBJECTIVE TO FOCUS ON POLICY HAS DRIFTED WITH EACH REGULATORY BODY DEFENDING THE INTERESTS OF ITS OWN CONSTITUENCY
461c030t MR. LI'S CAUTION MAY BE PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE FOR CHINA AT PRESENT DIPLOMATS IN BEIJING SAID
461c030u AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF SPECTACULAR GROWTH CHINA'S ECONOMY IS STRUGGLING
461c030v PRICES ARE SKYROCKETING CORRUPTION IS RAMPANT AND GRAIN PRODUCTION IS STAGNANT
461c030w EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL REFORMERS BELIEVE CHINA'S ECONOMIC PLANNERS SHOULD MOVE IN THE COMING YEAR TO SOLVE SUCH PROBLEMS BEFORE FURTHER REFORMS CAN BE INTRODUCED
461c030y THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF U. S. FOOD EXPORTS BUT WHETHER THOSE EXPORTS ARE SOLD AT A PROFIT OR A LOSS
461c0310 THE WINNER WILL BE THROWN IMMEDIATELY INTO HIS ROLE AS COMEX AMBASSADOR
461c0311 THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION HE WILL BE FLOWN TO BOCA RATON FLORIDA FOR THE FUTURES INDUSTRY'S ANNUAL CONVENTION

461c0314 IN THE PAST THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO BUREAUCRATIC AND SLOW MOVING
461c0315 THE NEW MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE WILL SHORTEN THE APPROVAL CYCLE AND COMMUNICATION CYCLE WITH THE COMPANY MR. MCDONNELL SAID
461c0316 NOR IS THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN A MAGIC NUMBER STRESSED DOCTOR SHAW

461c031c W. J. SANDERS THE THIRD ADVANCED MICRO'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER BLAMED AN INDUSTRY WIDE SEA CHANGE FOR THE COMPANY'S PROBLEMS
461c031d CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY DESKTOP COMPUTER MAKERS ARE BUYING FEWER CHIPS BECAUSE THEY HAVE LARGE INVENTORIES OF UNUSED PARTS FOR THE PROBLEMS
461c031e BUT OTHER MARKET SPECIALISTS SAID ADVANCED MICRO'S PROBLEMS ARE UNIQUE AMID A SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY THAT REMAINS GENERALLY ROBUST
461c031f SHE SAID THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NEW MODEL TO EXPAND THE MARKET RATHER THAN CANNIBALIZE SALES OF CONVENTIONAL METHODS
461c031g THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA COMPANY DECLINED TO PROJECT SALES FOR THE NEW MODEL
461c031h IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DIASONICS SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT TWO POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS
461c0401 THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IN WASHINGTON HAS LOST TRACK OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS
461c0402 ITS TRACKERS FIGURE THAT AMERICAN ADULTS HAVE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKETS AND AROUND THE HOUSE
461c0403 BUT THAT IS ONLY ABOUT TWELVE .PERCENT OF THE BILLS AND LOOSE CHANGE THEY CAN'T DIRECTLY ACCOUNT FOR
461c0407 THE SPOKESMAN SAID XEROX IS STILL NEGOTIATING WITH PERSONAL COMPUTER SUPPLIERS ON AN AGREEMENT TO REPLACE THE ONE WITH OLIVETTI THAT EXPIRED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR

461c040b I HAVE TRUST IN HIM
461c040c I CHOSE HIM DIDN'T I
461c040d DOCTOR MAHATHIR SAID
461c040e BECAUSE OF THAT SOME WALL STREET PROFESSIONALS THINK THE STOCK LOOKS RATHER EXPENSIVE
461c040f IT HAS TRIPLED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE LARGELY ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
461c040g IT CURRENTLY TRADES AT ABOUT NINE TIMES CASH FLOW SAYS ALAN GAINES OF GAINES BERLAND AN INSTITUTIONAL BROKERAGE FIRM
461c040h THAT'S ABOUT A THIRTY PERCENT PREMIUM TO QUALITY OIL COMPANIES LIKE ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM EXXON AND MOBIL HE SAYS
461c040l IN AN INTERVIEW MR. EXLEY SAID DEMAND IS STRONG BOTH IN THE U. S. AND IN MAJOR FOREIGN MARKETS WITH PERSONAL COMPUTERS LEADING THE WAY
461c040m ALSO THE COMPANY WHICH OBTAINED ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF REVENUE FROM ABROAD LAST YEAR CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM THE WEAKER DOLLAR
461c040n IN ADDITION N. C. R. IS REPURCHASING ITS OWN SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET MR. EXLEY SAID
461c040q SO I THINK THE FED FUNDS RATE WILL BE AT SIX POINT FIVE PERCENT TO SIX POINT SEVEN FIVE PERCENT FOR THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS
461c040r THE HONDURAN LEGISLATOR AGAIN I'M ALMOST CONVINCED THAT THE SANDINISTAS ARE GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER
461c040s I THINK WE SHOULD GO INTO A PEACE PROCESS WITH THEM

461c040u THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES MAGAZINES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN OFF LIMITS TO ALL ADVERTISERS

461c040z THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIVE NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FOUR EIGHT CENTS
461c0410 THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP ZERO POINT FIVE EIGHT CENT TO SIXTY POINT THREE SIX CENTS A POUND
461c0411 ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED
461c0412 BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE
461c0413 BUT NOW THE COMPANY'S MARKETING ATTENTION IS SHIFTING COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE SAMURAI IN FAVOR OF THE TWO NEW VEHICLES
461c0414 SUZUKI OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL SPEND ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING BY YEAR END TO LAUNCH THE SWIFT AND THE SIDEKICK
461c0415 BY APRIL SUZUKI EXPECTS TO SHIP TWENTY THOUSAND OF THE CARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND OF THE SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES TO THE U. S.
461c0416 THIS PLAN DUBBED THE MIYAZAWA PLAN IN HONOR OF JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA SOUNDS JOLLY ON THE SURFACE
461c0417 BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER
461c0418 THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS
461c0419 THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES
461c041a THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT
461c041b AND THE JAPANESE WOULD BECOME CLOSE PARTNERS OF THE I. M. F. IN DEBT MANAGEMENT
462c0201 SURGING STOCK PRICES IN NEW YORK AND TOKYO AND THE PROSPECT OF LOWER WORLD WIDE INTEREST RATES FUELED THE LONDON RALLY DEALERS SAID
462c0202 FOREIGN INVESTMENT HAS BEEN HEAVY

462c0208 AFTER COLUMBIA'S PREVIOUS CHIEF MR. MCELWAINE LEFT LAST MAY VIRTUALLY NO NEW PROJECTS WERE STARTED
462c0209 AND BECAUSE ISHTAR RAN MONTHS OVER SCHEDULE COLUMBIA HAD NO MOVIE TO RELEASE DURING THE CRUCIAL CHRISTMAS BOX OFFICE SEASON

462c020i EVEN SOME SUPPORTERS NOW SAY PRIVATELY THAT HE SHOULD AIM FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION

462c020k WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT AD CHARACTERS HAVE THE SAME STATURE AS ZEUS MS. WEIS SAYS

462c0215 THE SPOKESMAN SAID OFFICIALS ARE SPEEDING WORK ON THE RULE IN THE WAKE OF A RECENT DISCOVERY OF SEVERE CRACKING IN ONE SECTION OF A CONTINENTAL AIRLINES SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN
462c0216 THE CRACK WAS DISCOVERED OCTOBER FIFTH WHEN PAINT WAS STRIPPED FOR REPAINTING
462c0217 INVESTIGATORS HAVEN'T DETERMINED THE CAUSE BUT ONE THEORY IS THAT THE PLANE HAD BEEN IMPROPERLY REPAIRED BEFORE IT WAS BOUGHT BY CONTINENTAL A UNIT OF TEXAS AIR CORPORATION
462c0218 TO BEGIN WITH COMPANIES HAVE BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB OF MANAGING INVENTORIES
462c0219 IN THE PAST BUSINESSES HAVE TENDED TO BECOME INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC AS EXPANSIONS PERSISTED
462c021a WHEN SALES EVENTUALLY SLOWED INVENTORIES QUICKLY REACHED EXCESSIVE LEVELS
462c021b COMPANIES THEREUPON CUT THEIR BUYING INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DECLINED AND A RECESSION WAS UNDER WAY
462c021c BUT MANY LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND ON TOURISM AREN'T CONVINCED
462c021d THEY ARGUE THAT A COMMERCIAL MINE MIGHT GET PLAYED OUT IN A FEW YEARS
462c021e AND THEY FEAR THAT MANY TOURISTS WHO TREK HERE FOR THE TANTALIZING PROSPECT OF FINDING A DIAMOND IN THE FIELD WILL TAKE THEIR VACATIONS ELSEWHERE

462c0310 OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE
462c0311 AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY

464c0307 THE ACTIVITY ENDED
464c0308 THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT UNIQUE
464c0309 OPPONENTS OF COVERT ACTIVITY HAVE DISCOVERED THAT BY LEAKING COVERT OPERATIONS INTO THE NEWS THEY CAN CREATE A DEBILITATING AURA OF SUSPICION AND ILLEGITIMACY AROUND FOREIGN POLICIES THEY DISLIKE
464c030a <NOISE> THE COMPANIES' SHARPLY IMPROVED RESULTS PROVIDED MORE EVIDENCE OF A REBOUND IN BOTH THE CHIP AND PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRIES
464c030b THE RESULTS FOLLOW A REPORT LAST WEEK FROM THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THAT THE BELEAGUERED CHIP INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING AN UPTURN
464c030c <NOISE> IN MARCH THE INDUSTRY'S LEADING INDICATOR REACHED THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR

464c0405 BEFORE FRIDAY IT SEEMED THAT ONLY AN UNEXPECTED BREAK IN THE DELAWARE COURT CASE COULD HAVE EXTRACTED HENLEY FROM THE DILEMMA IT NOW FACES
464c0406 THUS THE CASE WAS CLOSELY WATCHED
464c0407 BUT IT ALSO RAISED IMPORTANT ISSUES OF CORPORATE LAW
464c0408 <NOISE> THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE WAS A CONTENTION THAT SANTA FE'S BOARD ACTED ILLEGALLY LAST DECEMBER WHEN IT LOWERED THE THRESHHOLD FOR A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN TO TWENTY PERCENT

466c040o IT'S TRUE AS A METAPHOR FOR THE HUMAN AND COSMIC MYSTERIES
466c040p IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK ON THE METAPHOR THAT YOU GET IN TROUBLE
466c040q MR. HOWARD NOT ONLY HELPED THE FLEDGLING PUBLIC COMPANIES DRUM UP INTEREST IN THEIR SHARES HE HELPED INVEST THE CAPITAL THEY RAISED IN THE PUBLIC OFFERINGS
466c040r IN MANY CASES THE BANKS HE ADVISED INVESTED LARGE AMOUNTS IN EACH OTHER

466c0410 WE'VE ALWAYS WONDERED HOW TO SQUARE NICARAGUAN <NOISE> PRESIDENT DANIEL ORTEGA'S ROUGH WORDS WITH HIS SOFT TREATMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED U. S. CONGRESS
466c0411 MAYBE HE HAS TOO BECAUSE HE'S UPPED THE ANTE
466c0412 HE HAS NOW BRANDED NOT ONLY THE REPUBLICANS BUT ALSO THE DEMOCRATS AS IMPERIALISTS BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES HAVE TALKED RECENTLY ABOUT HELPING THE CONTRAS
466c0413 WHAT DO THE DEMOCRATS BECOME IF THEY ACTUALLY VOTE THE BANDAGES
466c0414 THE TREASURY IS SCHEDULED TO ANNOUNCE DETAILS OF ITS QUARTERLY FINANCING OPERATION NOVEMBER TWO
466c0415 IT USUALLY CONSISTS OF THREE YEAR NOTES TEN YEAR NOTES AND THIRTY YEAR BONDS
466c0416 BUT THE DEPARTMENT IS VERY CLOSE TO REACHING ITS LIMITS ON ISSUING LONG TERM DEBT AND THUS HAS ASKED CONGRESS TO INCREASE ITS AUTHORITY
466c0417 CONGRESS STILL HASN'T COMPLETED WORK ON THE ISSUE WHICH IS PART OF THE B- TAX BILL PASSED LATE TUESDAY BY THE SENATE
466c0418 CLARKE SWANSON NOTING THAT NINETEEN MILLION WOMEN HAD STAYED IN THE WORK FORCE AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THOUGHT THEY COULD USE HELP IN WHIPPING UP QUICK MEALS

467c0201 <NOISE> FIRST OF ALL THE POLICY CONSERVATIVES WILL PURSUE THEIR UNFINISHED AGENDA OF DEREGULATION IN AREAS FROM FINANCIAL SERVICES TO REGULATION AS A DRAG ON U. S. INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS
467c0202 THEY SAY THE ADMINISTRATION MISSED ITS CHANCE AND ALLOWED ITS DEREGULATORY CAMPAIGN TO BE ALL BUT ABORTED BY CONTROVERSY OVER ANNE GORSUCH AND JIM WATT
467c0203 THEY THINK THEIR GENERAL CASE IN THIS AREA IS OVERWHELMING
467c0204 THEY WILL GIVE IT NEW APPLICATIONS AND CARRY IT TO NEW FORUMS
467c020d STILL MR. JOSEPHS AND OTHERS THINK THAT THE CHANGES WILL BE GOOD FOR THE FARM ECONOMY IN GENERAL
467c020e MANY OF THESE GENTLEMEN FARMERS WERE TAX MOTIVATED NOT PROFIT DRIVEN HE SAYS
467c020f <NOISE> SOME ARE UNFAIR COMPETITION AGAINST THE REGULAR FARMER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK
467c020g ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO SOUTHLAND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS CONSIDERING RESTRUCTURING ALTERNATIVES BUT WOULDN'T ELABORATE
467c020h THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN ELEVEN STORES REPEATEDLY HAS SAID IT DIDN'T KNOW OF REASONS FOR THE HEAVY TRADING IN ITS STOCK

467c020j <NOISE> IN KOREA LABOR CONFLICTS HAVE ADDED HEAT TO THE UNSTABLE POLITICAL SITUATION
467c020k <NOISE> THE NEW UNIONS ARE GROWING MORE ADVERSARIAL
467c020l COMPANIES KEEP ASKING THE GOVERNMENT TO SMASH THE UNIONS
467c020m BUT THE RULING PARTY CAN'T RISK ALIENATING WORKERS WHO WILL VOTE IN THE COMING ELECTIONS
467c020n IT REFUSES SO FAR TO BACKTRACK ON ITS JULY ONE PROMISE OF GREATER DEMOCRACY OR TO RETURN TO THE POLICY OF OVERT UNION BUSTING

467c0210 THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND ONE QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
467c0211 THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
467c0215 IN CONTRAST SENATOR BENTSEN CAMPAIGNED LAST WEEK IN A HALF EMPTY PLANE TO A MEASURED CADENCE
467c0216 HE PORTRAYS GOVERNOR DUKAKIS AS A PRAGMATIC CAN DO EXECUTIVE
467c0217 AND HE OFFERS HIMSELF A BUSINESS ORIENTED SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND FORMER INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AS EVIDENCE OF THAT MODERATION
467c0218 THE RECURRING WORDS OF HIS SPEECHES ARE THE WORDS OF THE BOARDROOM COMPETENCE HANDS ON MANAGEMENT ENHANCED RECOVERY
467c0219 MR. KIDDER INSISTS THERE IS CAUSE FOR HOPE
467c021a GOOD TEACHERS PUT SNAGS IN THE RIVER OF CHILDREN PASSING BY AND OVER THE YEARS THEY REDIRECT HUNDREDS OF LIVES
467c021b PERHAPS HE IS RIGHT
467c021c BUT WHAT HE NOTICES AT THE FIFTH GRADE SCIENCE FAIR SEEMS MORE SIGNIFICANT
467c021d THE RESULTS OF THAT PAINFUL CHARADE DON'T REFLECT SOCIAL STATUS ETHNIC BACKGROUND OR TEACHING TECHNIQUE THEY REFLECT THE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH CHILD'S PARENTS
467c021e AVIATION INSURANCE IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE
467c021f THE GLOBAL AIRLINE PREMIUMS HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FROM ABOUT ONE BILLION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
467c021g MEANWHILE AIRLINE LOSSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR
467c0301 THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED HOWEVER
467c0302 A PROVISION IN THE SPENDING BILL REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE REPAIR AND OVERHAUL WORK ON SHIPS BE DONE LOCALLY AT THEIR HOME PORTS
467c0303 THAT MAKES IT A BIG DEAL FOR TODD AND LOCKHEED MR. DICKS SAYS REFERRING TO TWO PUGET SOUND SHIPYARDS
467c0307 INCO'S STOCK HAS CAUGHT TECHNICAL ANALYSTS' ATTENTION TOO <NOISE>
467c0308 IT RECENTLY BROKE OUT OF A FIVE YEAR TRADING RANGE SAYS MARTIN PRING EDITOR OF PRING MARKET REVIEW
467c0309 HE THINKS THE STOCK COULD BE POISED FOR BIG GAINS REFLECTING WHAT MAY BE A BULL MARKET IN BASE METALS
467c030a <NOISE> RENT CONTROL IS AS BAD AS THE INCOME TAX DEDUCTION FOR HOME OWNERSHIP
467c030b ALL THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE DEDUCTION ARE HIGH INCOME EARNERS NOT SIMPLY SOME OF THEM
467c030c IT LEADS TO EXTRA LARGE SWIMMING POOLS EXTRA BEDROOMS IN BEVERLY HILLS BUT NO HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST
467c030d STILL WHEN THIS ISSUE WAS LAST VOTED ON IN CONGRESS EIGHTY FIVE OUT OF EIGHTY FIVE SENATORS PRESENT VOTED FOR IT
467c030e THE ONLY SURPRISING THING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES IS THAT SOMEHOW THE OTHER FIFTEEN SENATORS DIDN'T MANAGE TO GET THEIR NAMES ON THE ROLL CALL
467c030f MR. ZINN SAID ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING IS STILL WEIGHING A PROXY FIGHT
467c030g IT'S A BAD FEELING IN YOUR STOMACH WHEN THE CHAIRMAN AND PREVIOUS BIDDER IS SELLING HIS BLOCK HE SAID
467c030h IT DOESN'T MAKE ME AS A SHAREHOLDER COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE COMPANY
467c030i UNDER THE PLAN THE EDELMAN GROUP WOULD CONTRIBUTE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN EQUITY TO THE TRANSACTION
467c030j THE REMAINDER WOULD BE FINANCED WITH DEBT AND DEBT SECURITIES
467c030k IF THE PLAN SUCCEEDS SHEARSON WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE WARRANTS TO BUY TEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FULLY DILUTED COMMON EQUITY OF THE COMPANY
467c030l FRANK PEREZ A RETIRED DIPLOMAT RECALLS THE DAY HE LEFT FOR A TWO YEAR STINT AS THE DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION IN TURKEY
467c030m FIDELITY'S PACKERS HE SAYS SPREAD THE PEREZ FAMILY FURNISHINGS IN THE FRONT YARD THEN LEFT FOR AN EXTENDED LUNCH BREAK
467c030n MINUTES LATER THERE WAS A DRENCHING RAIN
467c030o IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHEN HE RETURNED MUCH OF THE FURNITURE WAS SOGGY AND MOLDY
467c030p WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO ME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
467c030q IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
467c030r FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
467c030s IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
467c030v IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN NEW YORK BASED BAIRNCO EARNED TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO MILLION OR TWO DOLLARS AND SIXTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE
467c030w THE KING'S REQUEST LEFT THE DELEGATES IN A TIGHT SPOT
467c030x TO IGNORE JORDAN AND MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL FORMAL CASH PLEDGE TO THE P. L. O. WOULD SIGNAL A SHIFT AWAY FROM MODERATION DIFFICULT FOR THE GULF STATES TO COUNTENANCE
467c030y BUT TO FINANCE BOTH JORDAN AND THE P. L. O. RISKED TRIGGERING A CLAMOR FROM OTHER CASH STRAPPED STATES COVERED UNDER THE BAGHDAD AGREEMENT SUCH AS LEBANON AND SYRIA
467c0310 <NOISE> ONE OF THE CREW MEMBERS CAN BE HEARD ON A COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER CALLING OUT FLAPS FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THE CORRECT POSITION FOR THE FLAPS
467c0313 WHILE THE ESTIMATED REVENUE OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED MILLION OVER THREE YEARS IS RELATIVELY SMALL THE PROVISIONS MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS AN ANTI TAKEOVER PUSH BY CONGRESS
467c0315 TO BE SURE THE DEFICIT HAS DECLINED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS
467c0316 BUT THAT DECLINE IS ENTIRELY THE RESULT OF A RISING SURPLUS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND
467c0317 THAT MONEY SHOULD BE INVESTED TO HELP DEFRAY THE FUTURE RETIREMENT COSTS OF THE BABY BOOMERS INSTEAD IT IS BEING USED TO PAPER OVER THE DEFICIT
467c0318 THAT'S YET ANOTHER SYMPTOM OF MR. DARMAN'S NATIONAL NOW NOW ISM
467c0319 THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
467c031a THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
467c031b BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
467c031c ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
467c031d AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
467c031e ASHTON TATE HAS BEEN PLAGUED BY OPERATING LOSSES AND MANAGEMENT TURMOIL
467c031f LAST MONTH IT REPORTED A NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR SECOND QUARTER NET LOSS AS WELL AS THE RESIGNATION OF ITS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
467c031g ONCE A SOFTWARE INDUSTRY STAR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN BUFFETED BY GROWING COMPETITION IN ITS CORE DATABASE BUSINESS
467c0404 THAT MAY BE BUT THERE ARE TOUGH CALLS
467c0405 EMOTIONAL UPSET HEADACHES BACKACHES AND OTHER SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS ARE HARD TO QUANTIFY
467c0406 *BESIDES* SOMEONE WHO TRULY FEELS DISABLED MAY AS A RESULT ACTUALLY BE DISABLED
467c0407 A WELL TIMED PERIOD OF TIME OFF WITH STRESS REDUCTION AND AN EFFORT AT BETTER UNDERSTANDING MAY PREVENT A MUCH WORSE DISABILITY LATER
467c0408 IT MAY ALSO UNCOVER FACTORS AT THE WORKPLACE THAT CAN BE IMPROVED
467c0409 I TRY TO GIVE THE PATIENT THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT WITHIN REASON
467c040a NOT DOING SO IS MORE THAN UNKIND IT RISKS HARM TO THE PATIENT AND LAWSUITS THAT NEITHER THE PHYSICIAN NOR EMPLOYER WOULD WELCOME
467c040b BUT SOME FIND ELECTRONIC INVESTING ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE
467c040c <NOISE> MR. JEFFERS ESTIMATES THAT A THIRD OF INVESTMENT SOFTWARE BUYERS EVENTUALLY JUNK THEIR PURCHASES BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY BAFFLES THEM
467c040d AND WHILE SOME INVESTORS SAY COMPUTERS HAVE MADE THEM MONEY OTHERS HAVE SQUANDERED SMALL FORTUNES BECAUSE THEY RELIED TOO HEAVILY ON TECHNOLOGY
467c040e <NOISE> BANKERS SAY CHILE MEXICO AND THE PHILIPPINES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE ESTIMATED SIX BILLION OF DEBT EQUITY SWAPS TO DATE
467c040f SOME BANKERS HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL MAY RISE AS HIGH AS TEN BILLION THIS YEAR
467c040g SUCH SWAPS ONLY BEGAN ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO
467c040h THE UTILITY WILL BEGIN PAYING INTEREST IN CASH AFTER SEABROOK GOES INTO SERVICE MR. BAYLESS SAID
467c040i MR. HARRISON SAID THE COMPANY DOESN'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO LEAP THE POLITICAL HURDLES THAT ARE BLOCKING SEABROOK
467c040j BUT THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING IS INTENDED TO KEEP THE COMPANY GOING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE HE SAID
467c040k JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS
467c040l BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES
467c040m I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED
467c040n HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT
467c040o DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE
467c040p THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON
467c040q THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED
467c040r BUT LONG BEFORE NOW THESE HIGHER PRICES WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MONTHLY MERCHANDISE TRADE DEFICIT AS WELL

468c0202 I'M DIMLY AWARE THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE SAYS RICHARD ULLMAN PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY AND A FORMER EDITOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MAGAZINE
468c0203 BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PEOPLE WHO PUBLISH SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT WOULDN'T WANT TO PUBLISH IN THE LEADING JOURNALS
468c0208 WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS

468c020f LAST SPRING BURLINGTON AGREED TO PAY REMAINING BONDHOLDERS A TOTAL OF THIRTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN RETURN FOR PERMISSION TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS

468c020j HOWEVER THE PERFORMANCE FELL FAR SHORT OF U. S. X. CHAIRMAN DAVID R- RODERICK'S PREDICTION OF FIFTY DOLLARS PLUS PER TON PROFIT
468c020k TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
468c020l LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
468c020m BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
468c020n SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
468c020o WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
468c020p THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION
468c020w NOT TO WORRY SAYS H. FLINT RANNEY A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT
468c020x WE HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HE SAYS

468c0212 ONCE YOU GET THAT THEME THE LEVEL OF THE P. E. RATIO DOESN'T MEAN A DAMN SAYS MR. ROBINS
468c0213 IT'S ALL A BIT OF A MIRAGE
468c0214 YET ONE THAT SO FAR HAS WORKED
468c0218 WHAT BOTHERS THESE PEOPLE IS NOT THAT MRS. THATCHER POSES A DANGER TO THE SO CALLED UNIFIED EUROPEAN MARKET
468c0219 MRS. THATCHER IS NOT OPPOSED TO THIS
468c021a BRITAIN'S OWN MARKETS ARE MORE OPEN THAN THOSE OF MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES LONDON IS WAY AHEAD OF THEM ON CAPITAL MOVEMENT HAVING ABOLISHED EXCHANGE CONTROLS ALTOGETHER
468c021b THE CAUSE OF THE OUTRAGE IS THAT EUROPEAN UNITY IS THE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE REGULATORS AND SOCIALISTS HOPE TO EXPAND THEIR GRIP ON THE CONTINENT
468c021c NOW HIS LAUGHTER IS GONE
468c021d BECAUSE OF DRUGS HE IS DEAD
468c021e AND EVERY DAY MY HEART BREAKS A LITTLE MORE

468c021h WHAT'S MORE THE MAY TRADE DEFICIT WAS REVISED DOWN TO TEN POINT OH TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TEN POINT TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ORIGINALLY REPORTED
468c0301 SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS
468c0302 BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT
468c0303 MANY JAPANESE COMPANIES IN SUCH INDUSTRIES AS STEEL AND SHIPBUILDING ARE CUTTING THEIR LABOR FORCES
468c0304 IN THE PAST FILIPINOS IN MANY RURAL AREAS PREFERRED THE DISCIPLINED TERROR OF THE N. P. A. TO THE RANDOM EXCESSES OF THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY
468c0305 WITH THE CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR A MILD IMPROVEMENT IN MILITARY BEHAVIOR AND THE DETECTION OF THE MINDANAO SLAUGHTERS SOME FILIPINOS ARE CHANGING THEIR MINDS
468c0306 DIPLOMATS AND POLITICAL ANALYSTS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW IF THE TREND PRESAGES SIGNIFICANT POPULAR RESISTANCE TO THE COMMUNISTS OR JUST ADDITIONAL TURMOIL IN THE PHILIPPINE COUNTRYSIDE
468c0307 THERE IS A WIDE VARIATION IN THINKING ABOUT HOW SICK ONE IS AND HOW IMPORTANT TIME OFF IS IN ORDER TO GET WELL
468c0308 THE PATIENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF WORK ALSO VARY
468c0309 IT'S HARD TO SAY TO WHAT DEGREE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INFLUENCE DISABILITY STATUS
468c030a MOST PHYSICIANS PROBABLY CONSIDER THEM IMPORTANT
468c030b IN CLEVELAND HIGBEE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROBERT BROADBENT SAYS THE RETAILER HAS BENEFITED FROM ITS PARENT'S FINANCIAL EXPERTISE

468c030k WITHIN AN HOUR BARCLAYS P. L. C. LLOYDS BANK P. L. C. AND THE LONDON UNIT OF CITICORP INCREASED THEIR BASE RATES

468c030u TOPEKA SAID IT INTENDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION
468c030v THE BIGGEST HURDLE WAS TO FIND THE FUNDS TO MEET THE COST OF RECONSTRUCTION INCLUSIVE OF THE ISSUE OF STAMPS
468c030w HOWEVER THE RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERNATIONAL APPEAL FOR ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HEARTWARMING

468c0401 THE COURT WAS SPLIT ON BOTH THE WILLIAMS ACT AND COMMERCE CLAUSE
468c0402 JUSTICE LEWIS POWELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO CASE OF EDGAR VERSUS
468c0403 M. I. T. E. SUGGESTED THAT ANY STATE LAW THAT FAVORED TARGETS MORE THAN DID THE WILLIAMS ACT WOULD BE INVALID BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD PREEMPTED LOCAL REGULATIONS
468c0404 THE COURT BACKTRACKED HERE TO SAY STATE LAWS MIGHT BE O. K. IF THEY HELP THE WILLIAMS ACT'S PURPOSE BY HEAPING EVEN MORE BURDENS ON ACQUIRERS
468c0405 IT HAS RELIEVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION FELT BY THE FARMERS SAYS PETER BRENT A MEMBER OF A FARM ACTIVIST GROUP
468c0406 IF THEY GO TO MEDIATION AT LEAST THE LENDER HAS TO LISTEN
468c0407 NEARLY A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE INQUIRED INTO IOWA'S PROGRAM
468c0408 AND MANDATORY MEDIATION MODELED ON IOWA'S PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND MISSOURI LEGISLATURES
468c0409 OGILVY IS THE NATION'S FIFTH LARGEST ADVERTISING AGENCY WITH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BILLINGS OF THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS
468c040a ROUGHLY HALF OF THOSE BILLINGS CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE U. S. MR. ROMAN SAID
468c040b AGENCIES TRADITIONALLY HAVE TAKEN FIFTEEN PERCENT OF BILLINGS AS A COMMISSION
468c040k DESPITE ALL THE UNCERTAINTY THAT SURROUNDED BRITISH PETROLEUM'S JUMBO OFFERING THERE WASN'T THAT MUCH TURMOIL IN THE MARKET WHEN SHARES BEGAN TO TRADE FRIDAY
468c040l B. P.'S PARTIALLY PAID AMERICAN DEP:OSITORY SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT SEVENTEEN AND A QUARTER WITH THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION TRADED
468c040m IT WAS THE BIG BOARD'S MOST ACTIVE ISSUE
468c040t WE WANT MORE INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS SAYS A KEMPER SPOKESWOMAN
468c040u WE THINK THE BUSINESS HOLDS CONSIDERABLE PROMISE FOR THE FUTURE SHE ADDS AND WE THINK CITICORP IS A CAPABLE ORGANIZATION
468c040v OTHERS SAY INSTITUTIONAL ASSET MANAGEMENT STILL IS CONSIDERED A GOOD BUSINESS DESPITE RELATIVELY LOW FEES AND SIGNS OF SLOW GROWTH
468c040w FIRST BOSTON AND XEROX HAD NO COMMENT
468c040x THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM
468c040y MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS
468c040z HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX
468c0412 THE MARKET HAS BEEN OVERDONE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE UPSIDE SAID RICHARD LOEWY SENIOR GRAIN AND OIL SEED ANALYST WITH PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES INCORPORATED
468c0414 ONE OF THE FOUR BUSINESSES INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION GRANTED TO K. K. R. IS MACMILLAN'S DIRECTORY DIVISION WHICH CONSISTS OF WHO'S WHO AND A NATIONAL REGISTER PUBLISHING
468c0415 THUS IT WASN'T IMMEDIATELY CLEAR WHY INTERNATIONAL THOMSON MIGHT BE LOOKING AT THE OPERATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LOCKUP OPTION
468c0416 A SPOKESMAN FOR K. K. R. ALSO DECLINED COMMENT
468c0417 THE DECISION FREES INTERIOR OFFICIALS TO FORMALLY OPEN OIL COMPANY BIDS TO LEASE UP TO FIVE POINT SIX MILLION ACRES IN A SALMON RICH AREA NEAR THE BERING SEA
468c0418 THE GOVERNMENT SOLICITED BIDS FOR THE SALE IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN BARRED BY COURT ORDER FROM OPENING THEM
468c0419 OFFICIALS SAID THE BIDS WOULD BE OPENED IN ANCHORAGE ALASKA TUESDAY
468c041b ECONOMIC COOPERATION WAS ADVANCED WITH BUSINESSMEN SIGNING AGREEMENTS FOR ABOUT THIRTY CONTRACTS WITH SEVERAL JOINT VENTURES
468c041d IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAG:ED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
468c041e SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
468c041f MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN A. S. E. A. N. POWERS
468c041g SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
468c041h SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
469c0204 THE SWISS FRANC BOND MARKET MEANWHILE REMAINED LISTLESS DESPITE A SHARP FALL IN THE DOLLAR
469c0205 MOST PRICES WERE UNCHANGED WITH AVERAGE TURNOVER TRADERS SAID

469c0207 CLOSELY HELD TRANSAMERICAN SAID IT ALSO AGREED TO SETTLE A DISPUTE WITH ANOTHER CREDITOR MEDALLION OIL COMPANY
469c0208 THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENTS WHICH MUST BE APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT WOULD REMOVE TWO MAJOR HURDLES IN TRANSAMERICAN'S LONG STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF THE CHAPTER ELEVEN PROCEEDINGS
469c0209 TRANSAMERICA FILED FOR COURT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS IN JANUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE WHEN IT WAS MIRED IN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT
469c020a I RECEIVED WELFARE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER MY SECOND CHILD WAS BORN
469c020b LUCKILY I WAS ABLE WITH THE HELP OF MY FAMILY TO GET A GOOD JOB AND RELIABLE CHILD CARE
469c020c BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF WELFARE MOTHERS OUT THERE WHO AREN'T THIS FORTUNATE
469c020d A LOT OF WOMEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET JOBS OR THE TRAINING NEEDED TO GET ONE AND SOMEONE TO WATCH THEIR CHILDREN
469c020e WHEN THAT SITUATION IS RESOLVED THEN YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FORMER WELFARE RECIPIENTS BECOMING PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY
469c020f THE SUN BELT FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY
469c020g ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTHEAST BUFFERED BY ITS BIG SERVICE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE NATION
469c020h BUT SOME OVERBUILT REAL ESTATE MARKETS COULD GET BASHED AND FLORIDA'S INFLUX OF RETIREES JOB SEEKERS AND TOURISTS COULD DWINDLE
469c020i THE SHAREHOLDER DAVID F. LAROCHE A PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND INVESTOR FILED THE SUIT IN A STATE SUPERIOR COURT IN NEWPORT
469c020j THE SUIT REQUESTS THE COURT TO ISSUE ORDERS PROHIBITING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION AND REQUIRING NECO TO HOLD ITS ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO ELECT FOUR DIRECTORS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

469c020o EL SALVADOR'S DUARTE TRAVELED TO THE U. S. FOR TREATMENT OF WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A MALIGNANT STOMACH DISEASE
469c020p THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN RUMORED TO HAVE CANCER
469c020q A SPOKESMAN SAID TESTS WOULD BE CONDUCTED AT WALTER REED ARMY MEDICAL CENTER IN WASHINGTON
469c020t THE AGENCY HOPES TO REALIZE ITS TARGET PRICE OF THIRTEEN MILLION
469c020u THUS INSTEAD OF CALMART'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE RELATIVELY SAFE FROM HANDS
469c020v CALMAT WOULD RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
469c020w INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
469c020x MR. CHATICHAI'S WEALTHY FAMILY BACKGROUND AND HIS FAMILY'S LARGE PROPERTY INTERESTS GIVE HIM A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY
469c020y FURTHER HE HAS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY AND SERVES AS CHAIRMAN OF THE THAI CHINESE FRIENDSHIP ASSOCIATION
469c020z THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTRY'S BUSINESS ELITE MANY OF WHOM ARE ETHNIC CHINESE
469c0218 I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
469c0219 THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
469c021a THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE IS SUCH THING AS EVIL
469c021b BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS
469c021c THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY
469c021d HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES
469c021e BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER AT ALL THIS WEEK
469c0303 THE DISPUTE INCLUDES ALLEGATIONS THAT GENCORP FAILED TO *ADEQUATELY* INFORM THE F. C. C. OF ALLEGEDLY IMPROPER CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS
469c0307 <NOISE> <NOISE> J. W. T. HADN'T YET RESPONDED TO W. P. P.'S WEDNESDAY BID OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE OR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION
469c0308 ON FRIDAY W. P. P. LAUNCHED A HOSTILE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR J. W. T.'S APPROXIMATELY TEN MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
469c0309 THAT HOSTILE OFFER FORMALLY REMAINED IN EFFECT DESPITE W. P. P.'S LATEST MOVE
469c030a AT A MEETING WITH ANALYSTS ROBERT M. KAVNER A. T. AND T.'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER SAID IT APPEARS WE WILL HAVE A GOOD YEAR
469c030b BUT IN RESPONSE TO AN ANALYST'S QUESTION HE SAID EARNINGS OF TWO DOLLARS A SHARE SOUNDS STRONG
469c030c HE ALSO WARNED ANALYSTS AGAINST LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR QUARTER AND ISOLATING IT ADDING WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE ANNUAL TREND LINE
469c030h WITH A REBOUND IN THE STOCK MARKET INVESTORS' FEARS ABOUT A RECESSION COOLED AND THE BOND MARKET SLUMPED
469c030i A SHARP SLIDE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR ALSO ADDED SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO BOND PRICES
469c030j DESPITE THE DECLINE IN BONDS THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE GOOD ON ITS PROMISE TO PROVIDE AMPLE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS
469c030n UNTIL NOW *NASDAQ* OR OTHER N. A. S. D.'S AUTOMATED QUOTATION SYSTEMS HAS PROVIDED COMPUTER TERMINALS WITH PRICE QUOTATIONS ON ALL ISSUES
469c030o MOST BIG TRADES HOWEVER ARE NEGOTIATED BY TELEPHONE AND THEN RECORDED IN THE SYSTEM'S COMPUTERS
469c030p ONLY THE SMALL ORDER SYSTEM HAS PROVIDED TRADERS WITH THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE TRADES BY COMPUTER RATHER THAN BY TELEPHONE
469c030q STILL THE COMPANY INSIDERS SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WAS ENTIRELY MR. ASKERS'S PLAN AND WASN'T FORCED ON HIM BY THE I. B. M. BOARD
469c030r A DIRECTOR SAID THE BOARD LEARNED OF THE PLAN AT ITS MEETING LAST TUESDAY
469c030s <NOISE> JOHN FOUND EVERYTHING WAS COMING ONTO HIS DESK AND HE HAD MORE THAN HE COULD COPE WITH ANOTHER DIRECTOR SAID

469c030u THE E. P. A. PROPOSED MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR MUNICIPAL TRASH DUMPS THAT THE AGENCY ESTIMATED WILL COST EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR
469c030v THE PROPOSED RULES WOULD REQUIRE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DUMPS TO INSTALL GROUNDWATER MONITORING SYSTEMS
469c030w THEY WOULD ALSO CLOSE SOME DUMPS AND PUT SPECIAL CONDITIONS ON OTHERS IN CERTAIN AREAS
469c0310 RANDOM HOUSE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE NEWHOUSE FAMILY ADVANCE PUBLICATIONS INCORPORATED <NOISE> SAID THE MOVE WILL TAKE IT OUT OF THE TEXTBOOK T- PUBLISHING BUSINESS
469c0311 THE TWO DIVISIONS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION TO NINETY MILLION IN ANNUAL SALES SAID ROBERT L. BERNSTEIN RANDOM HOUSE CHAIRMAN
469c0312 MR. BERNSTEIN NOTED THAT RANDOM HOUSE HAS EXPANDED IN OTHER DIRECTIONS NOTABLY IN TRADE PUBLISHING
469c0313 TRADE BOOKS ARE ALL BOOKS SOLD DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN BOOK STORES AND THROUGH MAIL ORDERS
469c0314 ANSWER YES WITHOUT QUESTION
469c0315 IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITHOUT ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
469c0316 AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
469c0317 NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
469c0318 THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
469c0319 BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
469c031a THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER H. P.'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS
469c031b YOU BOUGHT H. P. STOCK IN THE PAST BECAUSE IT HAD MORE CONTROL OVER ITS DESTINY THAN OTHER ELECTRONICS FIRMS SAID MR. WU
469c031c TODAY H. P. HAS LESS CONTROL OVER ITS FUTURE
469c0401 THE WORD IS TERROR
469c0402 MY FEAR OF FAILURE MAY BE GREATER IN SOME RESPECTS
469c0403 PEOPLE SAY ADVERSITY IS GOOD FOR YOU
469c0404 WELL THAT'S NOT EXACTLY TRUE
469c0405 I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON I WAS
469c0406 TRADING VOLUME HAS BEEN LETHARGIC FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS PARTLY REFLECTING CONFUSION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
469c0407 IMPORTANT CLUES ARE EXPECTED TO EMERGE FRIDAY WHEN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORTS EMPLOYMENT FIGURES FOR FEBRUARY
469c0408 MANY ANALYSTS EXPECT THE STATISTICS TO INDICATE THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK AND THAT LOWER INTEREST RATES LIE AHEAD
469c0409 BUT THE EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND INDIVIDUAL ESTIMATES VARY WIDELY
469c040a BUT SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT S. H. V.'S INTENTIONS
469c040b THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON THERE SAID HUMPHREY HARRISON AN ANALYST AT COUNTY SECURITIES
469c040c I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE END GAME IS BUT I DOUBT THEY S. H. V. WILL REMAIN AT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT

469c040i THE BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE THE LARGEST IN HISTORY CAME AFTER BOTH FIRMS APPARENTLY REMAINED ABOUT TWO !BILLION APART IN SETTLEMENT TALKS
469c040j THOUGH THE FILING !COMPLICATES THE BATTLE MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE NEITHER COMPANY WILL EMERGE THE WINNER
469c040k BUT THE OIL WORKERS HAD A CANDIDATE !TOO AND AS THE PRIMARY DREW NEAR STRANGE THINGS STARTED TO HAPPEN AT EBANO
469c040l NEIGHBORHOODS WITH TAP WATER SUDDENLY FOUND THEMSELVES CUT OFF
469c040m PHONES RANG WITH DEATH THREATS

469c040v BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH
469c040w NO FINAL BUDGET DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE WHITE HOUSE
469c040x BUDGET DRAFTING IS BEHIND SCHEDULE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WON'T EVEN SEE O. M. B. RECOMMENDATIONS UNTIL LATE THIS WEEK
469c040y BUT IT'S ALREADY CLEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCREASED ITS EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION
469c040z I THINK IT'S A PERFECTLY HONORABLE PROFESSION
469c0410 IF MORE OF US DID IT THE OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GET SMALLER BECAUSE MORE FIRMS WOULD BE COMPETING TO CLOSE THE SAME SPREADS HE SAYS
469c0411 THE PRODUCT IS A LEGITIMATE HEDGING PRODUCT AND A LEGITIMATE WAY TO ADD LIQUIDITY TO THE MARKET
469c0412 REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID INTENSE FRICTION BETWEEN *SALVATORE* RATIENI AND MR. DAVIS DEVELOPED DURING THE KIAWAH NEGOTIATIONS

46bc030t WHAT HAS DISTINGUISHED US IS THAT OUR RETURNS ON ASSETS AND EQUITY ARE FAR ABOVE AVERAGE
46bc030u MAINTAINING THOSE LEVELS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CHALLENGE

46dc030s A FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AND AN APPEALS COURT BOTH IN RICHMOND UPHELD THE PLAN
46dc030t BUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE SUPREME COURT TOLD THE APPEALS COURT TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION IN LIGHT OF ANOTHER HIGH COURT RULING
46dc030u LAST JULY THE APPEALS COURT STRUCK DOWN THE PLAN RULING THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION MUST BE BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE CITY ITSELF HAD DISCRIMINATED IN THE PAST
46dc030v <NOISE> PAST SOCIETAL BIAS ISN'T SUFFICIENT BASIS TO JUSTIFY THE PLAN THE APPEALS COURT SAID IN AN OPINION WRITTEN BY JUDGE J. HARVIE WILKINSON THE THIRD
46dc030w IT IS SAD BUT TRUE THAT INTERNATIONAL SPORTING EXTRAVAGANZAS HAVE COME TO BE CONDUCTED AMID THE SORT OF SECURITY OTHERWISE RESERVED FOR THE TRAVELS OF HEADS OF STATE
46dc030x THE SWISS HOCKEY COACH WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT HIS PLAYERS WERE SURPRISED THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO SHOW THEIR PASSES AT THE BLUE LINE WHEN THEY BACK CHECKED
46dc030y HAVING THE BAR PATTERN ON MY PASS CHECKED ELECTRONICALLY ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES MADE ME FEEL LIKE A TOOTHPASTE CARTON LEAVING A SUPERMARKET
46dc030z FOR TWO YEARS AFTER HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE ELECTION HE PUT INTO EFFECT THE SOCIALIST PROGRAM OF FAST REFLATION AND WHOLESALE NATIONALIZATION
46dc0310 AS INFLATION SOARED AND THE FRANC NOSE DIVED HIS APPROVAL RATING PLUNGED
46dc0311 THEN HE CHANGED COURSE COMPLETELY
46dc0312 HIS NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AUSTERITY PROGRAM WAS APPLAUDED BY EVEN HIS RIGHT WING OPPONENTS
46dc0313 AFTER NAMING FOUR COMMUNISTS TO HIS ORIGINAL CABINET HE BROKE WITH THE COMMUNISTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND DESTROYED THEM AS A POLITICAL FORCE

46dc0319 ON SOME LEDGERS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO ADD TO UP TO FIFTY DOLLARS
46dc031a BUT SOME INSIDERS APPARENTLY PREFER THIRTY SIX DOLLARS TO THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS IN CASH

46dc031c <NOISE> THE TREASURY ATTRIBUTED THE DECLINE TO UNUSUALLY S:TRONG SALES OF BONDS IN OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE FIRST MONTH OF FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN

46dc0405 THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE
46dc0406 <NOISE> THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT
46dc0407 THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
46dc0408 BUT NEITHER EUROPEANS NOR AMERICANS SEEM ESPECIALLY EAGER
46dc0409 SOME EVEN CONTEND THAT CONVENTIONAL DEFENSES ARE ADEQUATE OR ARE GROWING IRRELEVANT
46dc040a NOT SO INSISTS MR. ABSHIRE WHO BELIEVES ENHANCING NATO'S CAPABILITIES IS OF ACCELERATING IMPORTANCE
46dc040b AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT QUARTERS THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS WERE MASKED BY SEVERAL SPECIAL CHARGES
46dc040c BEFORE A SIX MILLION DOLLAR LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PHILLIPS HAD PROFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR FIVE CENTS A SHARE
46dc040d THAT PROFIT INCLUDED A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM ASSET SALES AND AN EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR CHARGE FROM STAFF REDUCTIONS
46dc040e MUCH OF THE LITIGATION INVOLVING BUSINESS BROKERS CENTERS ON THE LARGER BETTER STAFFED CONCERNS CONCERNS LIKE BUSINESS BUYERS
46dc040f <NOISE> THAT COMPANY WHICH EXCLUSIVELY REPRESENTS BUYERS SAYS IT HAS SIGNED MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY CLIENTS SINCE IT OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
46dc040g MOST ARE CORPORATE EXECUTIVES IN THEIR LATE FORTIES WHO PAID THE FIRM UP TO A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR RETAINER D- FEE
46dc040h U. S. LAWMAKERS WHO ARE SYMPATHETIC TO ISRAEL ARE EXPECTED TO REACT TO THE REPORT BY PUBLICLY PRAISING ISRAEL FOR ITS RECENT STEPS
46dc040k THE HYUNDAI THAT NIFTY AND CHEAP LITTLE KOREAN CAR HAS CAUGHT ON IN THE U. S. AND NO DOUBT COULD COMPETE IN ANY MARKET IN THE WORLD
46dc040l SO OUR WILLIAM MCGURN INQUIRED INTO HOW MANY HAVE BEEN EXPORTED FROM KOREA TO JAPAN
46dc040m HE FOUND THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THE NUMBER WAS ZERO
46dc040n THIS WAS DOWN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WHEN EXPORTS REACHED ONE SOLD TO MITSUBISHI
46dc040r ON FRIDAY SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INCORPORATED SAID IT IS EASING PROGRAM TRADING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT
46dc040s WE DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THE PROBLEM SAID JEFFREY LANE PRESIDENT OF SHEARSON
46dc040t <NOISE> MR. LANE SAID HE WOULD RATHER SEE WALL STREET MODIFY ITS BEHAVIOR THAN HAVE WASHINGTON REGULATORS CLAMP DOWN
46dc040u WE'RE GIVING UP SHORT TERM GAINS FOR THE GOOD OF OUR CLIENTS HE ASSERTED
46dc040y UNLIKE TRADITIONAL WHOLE LIFE POLICIES IN WHICH THE PREMIUM AND DEATH BENEFIT ARE FIXED UNIVERSAL LIFE GIVES HOLDERS CONSIDERABLE LATITUDE TO VARY THEIR PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS
46dc040z BUT IT HAS LIMITED GUARANTEES AND MUCH INVESTMENT RISK IS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOLDER
46dc0410 PREMIUM DOLLARS ARE INVESTED IN THE SAVING PORTION OF THE PLAN AND MONEY IS DEDUCTED PERIODICALLY TO PAY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE INSURANCE COVERAGE
46dc0411 PRICES AT THE MASS RETAIL LEVEL HOWEVER HAVEN'T RISEN MUCH IN A DECADE PARTLY BECAUSE BIG RETAILERS USE TENNIS BALLS TO LURE SHOPPERS
46dc0412 <NOISE> I REMEMBER PURCHASING A CAN OF BALLS FOR TWO DOLLARS IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN SAYS WALTER L. HENRY A PITTSBURGH RECREATIONAL PLAYER
46dc0413 TWO WEEKS AGO I PICKED UP A CAN FOR A DOLLAR EIGHTY NINE

46dc0415 <NOISE> WE'VE SPOKEN TO VIRTUALLY EVERY COMPANY YOU CAN IMAGINE PLUS HALF A DOZEN MORE YOU WOULDN'T THINK OF MR. MEISTER SAID
46dc0416 HE DENIED INDUSTRY SPECULATION THAT F. N. N. IS LOOKING TO SELL THE COMPANY
46dc0417 WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN SELLING AND WE'RE NOT SOLICITING ANYTHING HE SAID
46dc0418 HOWEVER HE ADDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY WE WOULDN'T ENTERTAIN ANY REASONABLE OFFER FOR AT LEAST A PIECE OF F. N. N.
46dc041d FOOD BUYERS FOR ONE TEXAS SUPERMARKET CHAIN FURR'S INCORPORATED HAVE EVEN ASKED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT ACCORDING TO ONE MANUFACTURER
46dc041e I JUST LAUGHED SAID THE SALES MANAGER OF A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CANDY COMPANY WHO REFUSED THE DEMAND
46dc041f FURR'S WOULDN'T CONFIRM OR DENY THE CLAIM
46ec0201 HOW IS WALL STREET REACTING TO THE CHANGES
46ec0202 SOME INVESTMENT BANKERS FEEL THREATENED BY IT OTHERS SCOFF AT SUGGESTION THAT THESE EFFORTS ARE TRULY COMPETITIVE
46ec0203 BUT SOME SAY THE CASE ISN'T CLEAR
46ec0204 FEW DEVELOPERS ARE BIG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE COST OF THESE DIVISIONS
46ec0205 THE TEST WILL BE WHETHER THE NEW UNITS ARE ADDING VALUE TO THEIR ORGANIZATIONS
46ec0206 IF NOT ONE INVESTMENT BANKER SAYS THE PARTNERS WILL KILL THEM

46ec020p SOME WONDER WHETHER ALL THE CONVERSIONS DON'T MAKE MR. BEREGOVOY MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST THAN A BELIEVER IN THE MARKET ECONOMY
46ec020q BUT HIS AIDES SAY HE WAS CONVINCED HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING
46ec020r MR. BEREGOVOY SAID I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHAT I DO

46ec0212 HE PREDICTED THAT IT WILL BE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE WE LEARN WHETHER THE F. D. I. C. HAS CHOSEN OUR PLAN OR ANOTHER ONE
46ec0216 OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S *STOCK* MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS
46ec0217 CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES
46ec0218 TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY
46ec0219 SOME BANKING ANALYSTS DOUBT A LONDON OR TOKYO BANK WOULD MAKE A SIMILAR ACQUISITION ANYTIME HERE SOON
46ec021a AMONG OTHER THINGS SOME FOREIGN BANKS HAVE BEEN SHYING AWAY FROM ACQUIRING ASSETS IN THE U. S. BECAUSE OF UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH EXPENSES MANAGING THEM FROM AFAR
46ec021b INSTEAD THE TREND AMONG FOREIGN BANKS IS TO INCREASINGLY BUILD ALLIANCES WITH U. S. BANKS

46ec0303 A CANADIAN TRUST COMPANY IS SIMILAR TO A U. S. SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION
46ec0304 U. S. UTILITIES COULD ALSO INCREASE ORDERS OF FOREIGN URANIUM AHEAD OF ANY TOTAL IMPORT RESTRICTIONS ANALYSTS SAY
46ec0305 URANIUM FROM SOUTH AFRICA FOR EXAMPLE HAS ALREADY FALLEN UNDER ANTI APARTHEID SANCTIONS
46ec0306 BUT LAST YEAR SAID THE URANIUM INSTITUTE U. S. IMPORTS OF SOUTH AFRICAN URANIUM SURGED THREE HUNDRED PERCENT TO MORE THAN THIRTEEN POINT TWO MILLION POUNDS

46ec030d SEVERAL OWNERS OF CONTEMPORARY ART GALLERIES SAY THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE AFTERSHOCKS OF THE STOCK MARKET'S FALL BUT THEY STILL HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH DAMAGE
46ec030e I'M SURE THIS WILL HAVE SOME EFFECT ON MY BUSINESS SAYS DEALER JOHN WEBER IN NEW YORK
46ec030f I CAN ANTICIPATE THAT CORPORATE BUYING OF ART WILL BE AFFECTED DOWN THE PIKE
46ec030g <NOISE> BUT I'M NOT JUMPING OUT A WINDOW
46ec030h I'VE LIVED THROUGH RECESSIONS BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT TO REAL COLLECTORS ART IS AN OBSESSION
46ec030i THE SUPER RICH ARE NOT GOING TO STOP INDULGING THEMSELVES

46ec030p DAVID HOCKNEY HAS BEEN A KIND OF WUNDERKIND ON THE INTERNATIONAL ART SCENE SINCE HE BURST UPON IT IN HIS NATIVE BRITAIN IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES
46ec030q HE IS NOW FIFTY YEARS OLD AND THIS MID CAREER RETROSPECTIVE AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM MAKES CLEAR ONCE AGAIN HOW PRECOCIOUS AND PROLIFIC HE HAS BEEN
46ec030r IN FACT THE PROFUSION AND VARIETY OF MR. HOCKNEY'S WORK <NOISE> SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN THE SHOW'S ORGANIZERS SOME PROBLEMS WITH ITS PRESENTATION
46ec030s FOR ALTHOUGH MR. HOCKNEY'S TALENT AND ORIGINALITY ARE GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED HE IS REGARDED IN SOME QUARTERS AS MORE OF A GIFTED ILLUSTRATOR THAN A MAJOR ARTIST
46ec030t AND SINCE IN RECENT YEARS HIS WORK HAS TENDED TO BE INCREASINGLY DECORATIVE A CHRONOLOGICAL ARRANGEMENT WAS APPARENTLY THOUGHT TO BE TOO RISKY
46ec030u THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION EXCORIATED DANIEL ORTEGA FOR HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE CONTRAS
46ec030v IT CONTINUES TO QUIBBLE WITH PRETORIA FOR IGNORING THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS
46ec030w BUT IN A REMARKABLE DEMONSTRATION OF INCONSISTENCY IT NOT ONLY APPLAUDS ISRAEL'S DEAFNESS TO THE P. L. O. IT STUFFS LEGISLATIVE PLUGS IN ITS OWN EARS AS WELL
46ec030x CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WERE OBVIOUS AND QUICKLY MADE THEIR WAY INTO USE
46ec030y THE FIRST WAS A COMPOSITE TAPE THAT BROUGHT INFORMATION FROM VARIOUS MARKET CENTERS ONTO ONE TICKER TAPE
46ec030z A COMPOSITE QUOTATION DISPLAY SYSTEM SOON FOLLOWED ALLOWING CUSTOMERS AND BROKERS TO SEE QUOTES FROM ALL MARKETS ON A SINGLE SCREEN
46ec0310 AND AN INTERNATIONAL MARKET TRADING SYSTEM ALLOWED ORDERS COMING TO VARIOUS EXCHANGE FLOORS TO FLOW FROM ONE EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER QUICKLY EASILY AND AT NO COST
46ec0314 FOR A. B. C. NOW NUMBER TWO A HIT WITH ROSEANNE COULD MEAN A TURNING POINT
46ec0315 PRODUCER MARCY CARSEY SAYS SHE HAS THE SAME FEELING IN HER GUT AS SHE HAD BEFORE THE DEBUT OF COSBY
46ec0316 BUT THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS
46ec0317 THE COSBY SHOW'S CLARE HUXTABLE IS A LOVING LAWYER AND A MATRIARCH IN A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR SWEATER
46ec0318 ROSEANNE IS AN ACID TONGUED ASSEMBLY LINE WORKER IN AN OLD SWEATSHIRT
46ec031h ISRAELI SOLDIERS BLOCKED ABOUT ONE THOUSAND PALESTINIANS FROM ENTERING ISRAEL IN A TEST OF NEW IDENTIFICATION CARDS
46ec0401 CHICAGO CENTRAL AND PACIFIC IS ONE OF A SLEW OF NEW RAILROADS THAT ARE BEING CREATED AS MAJOR RAILROADS SELL LIGHTLY USED TRACKS
46ec0402 MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THEM HAVE BEEN FORMED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY COMPARED WITH FORTY SEVEN DURING THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION SAYS
46ec0403 MOST ARE SHORT LINES WITH FEWER THAN A HUNDRED MILES AND SOME ARE MUCH LONGER REGIONAL LINES OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILES
46ec0404 THE STATE SETS THE OFFICIAL RATE CURRENTLY TWO HUNDRED ZLOTYS TO THE DOLLAR
46ec0405 IT SETS THE PRICE OF VODKA NOW ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED ZLOTYS
46ec0406 THE STATE DOESN'T RUN THE BLACK MARKET OF COURSE
46ec0407 BUT ITS POLICE DON'T BREAK THE BIG RINGS EITHER
46ec0408 THEY SEEM CONTENT TO LET THE POLES TRADE THEIR LETTUCE
46ec0409 SOONER OR LATER PEWEX WILL GET MOST OF IT ANYWAY
46ec040c ALL OF THE WORLD'S EXPORTS AND IMPORTS COME TO ABOUT TWO TRILLION A YEAR
46ec040d BUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET TRADING AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE TRILLION A WEEK
46ec040f THE F. C. C. REJECTED PETITIONS FROM SEVERAL PARTIES MAINTAINING THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WITH CLOSER TIES TO THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY THAN HALLMARK
46ec040h THE F. C. C. SAID THE CONCERNS OVER FUTURE PROGRAMMING WERE IRRELEVANT TO THE TRANSFER
46ec040i A PAINSTAKINGLY CRAFTED FEDERAL BLUEPRINT ENVISAGED STATES CLUSTERING INTO A DOZEN OR SO REGIONAL COMPACTS <NOISE> EACH WITH ITS OWN DISPOSAL SITE
46ec040j BUT STATES HAVE RUN INTO ENORMOUS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC OBSTACLES IN TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THESE AGREEMENTS
46ec040k NOR HAVE STATES HAD MUCH LUCK IN CONVINCING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HOSTING A DISPOSAL SITE <NOISE> FOR EVEN THE MORE BENIGN VARIETIES OF NUCLEAR REFUSE CAN BE SAFE AND EVEN PROFITABLE

46ec040v A SENIOR NATO DIPLOMAT ACCUSED THE SOVIETS OF TRYING TO SEDUCE THE GERMANS AWAY FROM US
46ec040w IT IS NONE TOO SUBTLE WEDGE DRIVING HE TOLD REUTERS
46ec040x THE U. S. SUGGESTED THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AWARD THE PRIVATE TERMINAL CONTRACTS ONLY TO JAPANESE FIRMS THAT PROMISE TO USE FOREIGN SUBCONTRACTORS
46ec040y BUT THAT DIDN'T WORK
46ec040z JAPANESE COMPANIES PREFER TO DIVIDE THE WORK THAN COMPETE FOR IT
46ec0410 PLUNGING INTO A MARKET MOST INVESTORS ARE STRUGGLING TO ESCAPE HENLEY SPENDS SIX MILLION DOLLARS
46ec0411 FOR TEN DAYS IT BUYS TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE SANTA FE SHARES TRADED AND LIFTS ITS STAKE TO FOURTEEN PERCENT FROM FIVE PERCENT

46ec0413 IF I WERE IN THEIR SHOES I'D BE BUYING MY DAMNED STOCK HE ARGUES
46ec0414 AS JAPAN'S FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE GROWN AND BECOME MORE INTERNATIONAL SO HAS FOREIGN PRESSURE ON JAPAN TO CLEAN UP WHAT MANY PERCEIVE AS UNFAIR TRADING PRACTICES
46ec0415 AS A START JAPAN REVISED ITS SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE LAW LAST MAY
46ec0416 NOW THE FINANCE MINISTRY IS WRITING THE DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES THAT WILL GIVE THE NEW LAW MUSCLE WHEN IT GOES INTO EFFECT NEXT APRIL
46ec0417 AND JOURNALISTS SECURITY ANALYSTS AND SOME CORPORATE OFFICIALS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MINISTRY'S FIRST DRAFT
46ec0418 IN A RELATED MATTER A REVIEW COMMISSION ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ON OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THREW OUT OSHA CITATIONS AGAINST MORRELL
46ec0419 THE CITATIONS ISSUED IN APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CHARGED RECORD KEEPING VIOLATIONS

46fc0204 AFTER U. S. WARPLANES STRUCK LIBYA LAST APRIL RICHARD ROBINSON DROPPED PLANS FOR A TWO WEEK VACATION IN FRANCE AND IRELAND FEARING AN INCREASE IN TERRORISM
46fc0205 NOW MR. ROBINSON A DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED STOCKBROKER IN BOCA RATON FLORIDA PLANS TO VISIT WEST GERMANY THIS JUNE
46fc0206 BUT IF THEY START THE TERRORISM AGAIN I'LL HAVE TO RECONSIDER HE SAYS
46fc0208 SOME GUYS I KNOW BACK IN BARRINGTON ILLINOIS KEEP JUST TWO OR THREE HORSES AND HAVE A LOT OF FUN
46fc020g IT'S INCONCEIVABLE THAT THE DIRECTORATE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MR. RODRIGUEZ COMMENTS ONE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER WHO HAS STUDIED THE LOCAL REFUGEE SITUATION
46fc020h THE PEOPLE OF EL BARILLO ARE UNDER THE BOOT
46fc020i THEY'VE BEEN SMART ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
46fc020j THEY'VE ADAPTED
46fc020o MR. HOLMES A COURT ALSO FILED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SEEKING CLEARANCE TO BOOST HIS STAKE ABOVE TEN PERCENT <NOISE>
46fc020p SUCH A FILING IS REQUIRED UNDER ANTITRUST LAW IF AN INVESTOR WISHES TO INCREASE HIS HOLDINGS ABOVE THAT LEVEL
46fc020q IF HIS REQUEST IS GRANTED HE AND HIS GROUP COULD BUY AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF TEXACO
46fc020r A PURCHASE OF MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT WOULD REQUIRE ANOTHER FILING WITH THE AGENCIES
46fc020s HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON
46fc020t HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
46fc020u BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY
46fc020v G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S
46fc020w IN A RECENT PAPER PRESENTED TO FELLOW LOBBYISTS MISS FARTHING EXPLAINED HOW TO GET LEVERAGE FROM SUCH A PROGRAM
46fc020x SHE RECOMMENDED SENDING INVITATIONS FIRST TO MEMBERS OF TAX WRITING COMMITTEES AND TO SENIOR OPINION MOLDERS WHO LOBBY THEIR COLLEAGUES

46fc020z SEPARATELY WALL STREET SPECULATION GREW THAT MEDIA INVESTOR ROBERT MURDOCH WAS CONSIDERING ACQUIRING A STAKE IN LONDON BASED W. P. P.
46fc0211 BUT A W. P. P. SPOKESMAN SAID THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO CONTACT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO ACQUISITION OF W. P. P. SHARES BY MURDOCH
46fc0212 STATE WORKERS ARE ANOTHER CONSTITUENCY

46fc0214 DOWN THE STREET FROM MR. SANCHEZ'S SHOP CARLOS A GOVERNMENT MECHANIC SAYS HE GOES TO MANY PRO NORIEGA DEMONSTRATIONS
46fc0215 CHASE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THE SALE OF ITS COMPUTER SERVICES COMPANY INTERACTIVE DATA CORPORATION AND OFFICES IN PARIS

46fc0217 BIDS ON THAT ARE DUE IN MID APRIL
46fc0218 DOCTOR ZAGURY SAID HIS VACCINE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A PROTOTYPE FOR TESTING BUT WHETHER IT CONFERS PROTECTION AGAINST AIDS HASN'T BEEN PROVED
46fc0219 THE ULTIMATE TEST OF EFFICACY EXPOSING THE VACCINATED SUBJECTS TO THE LIVE AIDS VIRUS HASN'T BEEN DONE FOR ETHICAL REASONS
46fc021a HOWEVER THE NEXT STEP IS TO TEST A VACCINE IN A LARGE GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK OF BEING EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS
46fc021b DOCTOR ZAGURY SAID HE IS TRYING TO STREAMLINE HIS BOOSTER PROCEDURE TO MAKE IT MORE WIDELY APPLICABLE
46fc021c ODDLY AND SADLY NEITHER CANDIDATE HAS TALKED MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE
46fc021d MAYBE IT DOESN'T LEND ITSELF TO SLOGANS
46fc021e MAYBE MESSRS.
46fc021f BUSH AND DUKAKIS THINK THAT LIKE TAXES IT CRIPPLED WALTER MONDALE FOUR YEARS AGO
46fc021g MAYBE IT'S AN ISSUE THE CANDIDATES HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT
46fc0304 IN ADDITION TO THE WAR OF NERVES OVER DISCOUNTS RETAIL EXECUTIVES SAID THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A BIG HIT IN THE TOY DEPARTMENT
46fc0305 BUT RETAILERS HAVE SEEN STRONG SALES OF BIG TICKET ITEMS TO WELL HEELED CUSTOMERS
46fc0306 THEY ARE BUYING TO BEAT THE NEW TAX LAW WHICH WILL END THE DEDUCTION OF SALES TAXES AND SOME INTEREST EXPENSES
46fc030a THE NEW POLICY ISN'T CLEARLY DELINEATED
46fc030b IT STIPULATES THAT NO NEW DEFENSE CONTRACT WILL BE SIGNED
46fc030c BUT MR. PERES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO REPORTERS' QUESTIONS ON HOW LONG EXISTING ARMS EXPORT CONTRACTS WITH SOUTH AFRICA WILL RUN
46fc030n ANOTHER INCENTIVE THAT FOOD PROCESSORS CITE FOR GETTING INTO THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS THE HIGH COST OF INTRODUCING NEW GROCERY ITEMS
46fc030o STARTING A NEW BRAND CAN EASILY COST GENERAL MILLS MORE THAN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION COSTS
46fc030p OF COURSE THE OLIVE GARDEN START UP BRICK AND MORTAR AND ALL HAS COST FIVE TIMES THAT
46fc030q PRATT AND WHITNEY SAID LAST WEEK IT MIGHT LAY OFF EMPLOYEES AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE OF DECREASED DEMAND FOR JET ENGINES AND PARTS
46fc030r THE COMPANY DECLINED TO DISCUSS HOW MANY EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE LAID OFF OR IF THE LOSS WOULD BE PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY
46fc030s BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAS TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND
46fc030w BUT U. S. MANUFACTURERS WHO TOOK A BEATING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS DECADE CONTINUE TO ENJOY A ROARING REVIVAL THAT BEGAN LAST YEAR

46rc0303 WITH THE FACILITY PLESSEY HOPES TO TRIPLE ITS ANNUAL SEMICONDUCTOR SALES TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BY NINETEEN NINETY
46rc0307 THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING
46rc0308 WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY SH- COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST
46rc0309 NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES
46rc030a GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF INMATES TO FILL NEW FACILITIES
46rc030h BUT THE ORDER ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GENERATED INTENSE CONTROVERSY BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CABINET
46rc030i IT BECAME SAID ONE CREDITOR THE POINT OF IMPACT FOR DEBATE ON THE ENTIRE RESCHEDULING PACKAGE AND FOREIGN DEBT

46rc030k PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIONS
46rc030l TAXES WOULD GO UP FOR CORPORATIONS CONSISTING OF LAWYERS DOCTORS ACCOUNTANTS AND ARCHITECTS
46rc030m <NOISE> THE PROVISION WOULD ELIMINATE GRADUATED RATES FOR THESE PERSONAL SERVICE CORPORATIONS SO THAT THEY ALL WOULD PAY THE FLAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT CORPORATE RATE
46rc030n WHY SHOULD FOREIGN IMPORTS BE A BETTER MEASURE OF U. S. EXPORTS
46rc030o AND WHY ARE THE EXPORT DATA SO BAD
46rc030p <NOISE> IMPORT DATA ARE DIRECTLY COLLECTED BY A SINGLE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THEY PROVIDE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS AND THEY PROVIDE POLITICALLY IMPORTANT MEASURES OF GOODS SUBJECT TO QUOTAS
46rc030q THESE ASPECTS OF IMPORT ACCOUNTING ENCOURAGE GOVERNMENT AGENTS TO AMASS ACCURATE IMPORT DATA
46rc030r CONVERSELY FOR EXPORTS SELF INTEREST INDUCES UNDERREPORTING
46rc030t GROWING LIFE EXPECTANCY THREATENS TO BANKRUPT SOCIAL SECURITY BUT THE COMPROMISE OF NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE DID LITTLE MORE THAN BURDEN WORKERS BY RAISING THE PAYROLL TAX
46rc030v SOVIET INFLUENCE IN NICARAGUA THREATENS U. S. SECURITY BUT THE U. S. HOUSE ENGAGES IN A PITCHED BATTLE OVER EVEN SCRAPS OF MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE CONTRAS
46rc030z ONE MILLION FAMILIES FALL INTO POVERTY EACH YEAR BECAUSE OF THE DEVASTATING COSTS OF LONG TERM ILLNESS
46rc0310 THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM
46rc0311 WE NEED A SOCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT WILL PROTECT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AGAINST THE FINANCIAL BURDENS OF LONG TERM ILLNESS
46rc0312 THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY BE BOUGHT IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS THE FILING SAID
46rc0313 PENNANT ADDED HOWEVER THAT ITS INTENTION TO RAISE ITS STAKE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE
46rc0314 A BAY SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE FILING
46rc0318 THE INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES AT BERLIN WILL CONTINUE TO STRESS TACKLING THE DEBT PROBLEM ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS
46rc0319 ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM BODIES SUCH AS THE I. M. F. WILL REMAIN CONDITIONAL ON ECONOMIC CHANGES IN THE DEBTOR COUNTRIES
46rc031a DEBT FORGIVENESS EXCEPT FOR THE POOREST COUNTRIES IN AFRICA WILL REMAIN A MATTER FOR DISCREET NEGOTIATION
46rc031b QUITE POSSIBLY A RECENT PROFIT SHARING BONUS HELPED
46rc031c WE DON'T HAVE AN ELEGANT FORMULA SAYS MR. BARRON
46rc031d WE SAID WE THINK EVERYONE'S ENTITLED TO A SHARE SO HERE'S A CHECK
46rc031e <NOISE> NEXT YEAR IF WE DO WELL THERE MAY BE A BIGGER CHECK
46rc031f IS THIS ANY WAY TO RUN A RAILROAD
46rc031g COULD BE
46rc0401 <NOISE> FINALLY FAILURE HAS A SOCIAL VALUE IF AN IGNOBLE ONE
46rc0402 IF EVERYONE WERE A SUCCESS IF THE WORLD WERE PEOPLED ONLY BY SUCCESS STORIES IT WOULD BE A RELENTLESSLY BORING PLACE TO LIVE IN
46rc0403 WHOM THEN WOULD WE HAVE TO LOOK DOWN UPON
46rc0404 AS THE SAYING GOES IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SUCCEED
46rc0405 MY FRIENDS MUST FAIL ALSO
46rc0406 ANY STUDENT OF HUMAN NATURE KNOWS THIS IS ONLY HALF A JOKE
46rc0407 HE IS CREDITED WITH DRILLING THE PRESIDENTS OF TRUST COMPANY'S EIGHTEEN GEORGIA BANKS ON THOSE FUNDAMENTALS SETTING AMBITIOUS PROFIT TARGETS AND HOLDING THE BANKS STRICTLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR REACHING THEM
46rc0408 NOW SUN'S TWENTY SIX FLORIDA BANKS GET THE SAME TREATMENT FROM MR. WILLIAMS
46rc0409 <NOISE> THERE'S A LOT OF AUTONOMY BUT YOU'VE GOT TO EARN IT SAYS THOMAS S. CLARK THE MARKETING DIRECTOR AT SUN'S POLK COUNTY BANK
46rc040a <NOISE> BUT MR. MORRIS INDICATED THAT THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S INTERESTS APPEARED TO BE ELSEWHERE
46rc040b AFTER REFINANCING IS COMPLETE IMPROVING THE MARKETING OPERATIONS AT FLYING TIGER IS THE FOCAL POINT OF HIS STRATEGY AT THIS POINT MR. MORRIS SAID
46rc040c TAX CREDITS ALSO WOULD BE USABLE IF THE AIRLINE WERE TO TURN A LARGE PROFIT HE NOTED
46rc040g <NOISE> MR. KELLEY'S APPOINTMENT STILL LEAVES ONE VACANCY ON THE SEVEN MEMBER FED BOARD
46rc040h <NOISE> PRESIDENT REAGAN ISN'T EXPECTED TO FILL THAT SEAT WHICH WAS VACATED BY HENRY WALLICH UNTIL HE DECIDES WHETHER TO REAPPOINT PAUL VOLCKER AS CHAIRMAN
46rc040i MR. VOLCKER'S TERM AS CHAIRMAN EXPIRES IN AUGUST
46rc040m IT HAS BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY THAT THE PUBLIC SUPPORTS THE BASIC IDEA OF DEFENDING THE U. S. FROM INCOMING BALLISTIC MISSILES
46rc040n IF MR. REAGAN WANTS S. D. I. TO BE A LASTING LEGACY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO START BUILDING ON THE SUPPORT THAT ALREADY EXISTS
46rc040o <NOISE> THAT TASK WILL BE MADE EASIER IF THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES THE DEVELOPING EVIDENCE OF THE SOVIET THREAT
46rc040u WESTERN ANALYSTS HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT PAKISTAN IS AT LEAST CLOSE TO POSSESSING THE NECESSARY MATERIALS AND KNOWLEDGE TO BUILD AND TEST A BOMB
46rc040v THE COUNTRY HAS REFUSED TO SIGN THE NUCLEAR NON PROLIFERATION TREATY UNLESS RIVAL INDIA WHICH EXPLODED ITS FIRST NUCLEAR DEVICE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR DOES SO
46rc040w PAKISTAN HAS PROPOSED VARIOUS NON PROLIFERATION CONTROLS ON ITS OWN PROGRAM BUT ONLY IF INDIA AGREES TO THE SAME CONTROLS
46rc0410 <NOISE> THE MICRO CHANNEL IS OUR STRATEGY SAID BILL LOWE THE HEAD OF I. B. M.'S P. C. DIVISION
46rc0411 WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENTLY SAYING THAT SINCE APRIL NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WHEN THE P. S. TWO LINE WAS INTRODUCED
46rc0412 IF WE KEPT CHANGING DIRECTIONS I COULD SEE PEOPLE QUESTIONING THAT
46rc0419 DAIMLER BENZ HASN'T YET SIGNED ON THE DOTTED LINE
46rc041a ITS SUPERVISORY BOARD IS TO VOTE ON THE PLAN TOMORROW
46rc041b THE MATTER IS EXPECTED TO CLEAR THE COALITION GOVERNMENT'S PARLIAMENTARY BOARD BUDGET COMMITTEE TOMORROW
46rc041c THE PURCHASE PRICE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION MARKS FOUR HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE DETERMINED LATER
46sc0204 BUT THE NEW LAW ALSO CONTAINS NEGATIVES FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS
46sc0205 FOR PEOPLE WHO MUST PAY THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX THE PRIVATE PURPOSE VARIETY IS NOW SUBJECT TO TAX
46sc0206 AND THE LOWERING OF TAX BRACKETS MEANS THAT THE SHELTER FEATURE IS LESS CRUCIAL THAN IT ONCE WAS
46sc0207 IN BOTH THE HUNGARIAN AND SUEZ CRISES <NOISE> THE UNITED STATES PROCEEDED IN ACCORD WITH THE RULE OF AVOIDING DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE SOVIET UNION
46sc0208 IN THE HUNGARIAN AFFAIR THIS MEANT DOING NOTHING EXCEPT TALKING BECAUSE TAKING ANY PRACTICAL STEP WOULD AT ONCE HAVE MEANT A CONFRONTATION
46sc0209 IN THE SUEZ AFFAIR THE AVOIDANCE OF CONFRONTATION WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE COLLABORATION
46sc020a BY CONTRAST THE INDUSTRIAL COMMUNIST NATIONS HAVE A FERTILITY MODESTLY ABOVE REPLACEMENT
46sc020b THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES HAVE A T. F. R. OF FOUR POINT ONE
46sc020c THE U. S. HAD A T. F. R. OF THREE POINT EIGHT IN NINETEEN FIFTY SEVEN AT THE PEAK OF THE BABY BOOM

46sc0303 WE'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR SOME TIME AND ARE REVIEWING THE APPLICATION <NOISE> SAID A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IN WASHINGTON
46sc0304 <NOISE> CHICAGO OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR FIGHTING THE H. U. D. MOVE
46sc0305 WE DON'T WANT A COMMISSAR RUNNING PUBLIC HOUSING SAYS ALTON MILLER MR. WASHINGTON'S PRESS SECRETARY
46sc0306 <NOISE> IT WOULD BE CRAZY TO HAVE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNNING WHAT IS IN EFFECT THE SECOND LARGEST CITY IN ILLINOIS
46sc0307 PORTIONS OF A DRAFT REPORT ARE SLATED TO BE READY BY THE SECOND WEEK IN SEPTEMBER <NOISE> BUT DEPOSITIONS AND CLOSED DOOR INTERVIEWS OF WITNESSES CONTINUE
46sc0308 *PARTISAN* BICKERING COULD PUSH COMPLETION OF THE REPORT BACK TO THE OCTOBER THIRTIETH DEADLINE

46sc030f GENERAL RAMOS SAID THE MILITARY WAS INVESTIGATING THE PRESENCE OF SOME FOREIGN PERSONNEL <NOISE> NEAR ARMED FORCES HEADQUARTERS DURING THE UPRISING
46sc030h NEVERTHELESS SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE FED ALREADY MAY BE TIGHTENING CREDIT SLIGHTLY
46sc030i THEY POINT TO RECENT INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS THE RATE ON RESERVES THAT BANKS LEND TO EACH OTHER OVERNIGHT
46sc030j THE FUNDS RATE AVERAGED S- SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS PERCENT YESTERDAY AND TUESDAY UP FROM AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN POINT FOUR THREE PERCENT IN THE WEEK ENDED OCTOBER SEVENTH
46sc030k THESE ANALYSTS ARGUE THAT THE INCREASE WAS ENGINEERED BY THE FED

46sc030r CITICORP'S LOSS FOR THE YEAR STEMMED FROM A THREE B- BILLION DOLLARS ADDITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER TO LOSS RESERVES FOR LOANS TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
46sc030s EXCLUDING ONE TIME GAINS AND LOSSES CITICORP'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
46sc030t EXCLUDED ARE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER <NOISE> AND PENSION ASSETS IN THE THIRD QUARTER PLUS THE EFFECT OF THE RESERVE ADDITION
46sc030u THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER
46sc030v <NOISE> BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
46sc030w <NOISE> S. C. I. SYSTEMS <NOISE> CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
46sc0311 THE TRADE BILL WOULD DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL ACTION AGAINST COUNTRIES THAT PERMIT PIRACY OF U. S. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
46sc0312 <NOISE> IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS <NOISE> AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES
46sc0313 <NOISE> THE PRESIDENT COULD DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH
46sc0314 CONGRESS WANTS SPEEDY ACTION BECAUSE TIME OFTEN CAN BE CRITICAL IN WINNING PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCH AS COMPUTER SOFTWARE WHICH CAN BE COPIED RAPIDLY
46sc0315 <NOISE> <NOISE> WHEN STEVE YOUNG WAS GROWING UP IN GREENWICH CONNECTICUT <NOISE> HE WAS THE BEST ATHLETE AROUND

46sc0318 WE ARE IN EFFECT OUT OF BUSINESS FOR AWHILE SAID JOHN SCHMIDT CO OWNER OF SCHMIDT AND SCHMIDT INSURANCE ASSOCIATES IN SAN FRANCISCO
46sc031b <NOISE> MR. MARTENS SAID VITRO WASN'T PREPARED TO AGREE TO THAT CONDITION
46sc031c HE SAID APPARENTLY ANCHOR IS CONCERNED THAT THE INFORMATION IT IS OFFERING TO PROVIDE WILL GIVE VITRO A BASIS FOR LOWERING THE PRICE
46sc031d <NOISE> INDEED THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY ANCHOR GIVE VITRO A BASIS TO LOWER THE BID
46sc040b IT'S THE LIFE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR AND THE FATE OF CREATIVITY IN A MODERN FINANCIALLY ORIENTED AMERICA MR. LUCAS SAYS WARMING TO THE SUBJECT

46sc040d <NOISE> ALTHOUGH TUCKER IS SET IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES MR. LUCAS MAKES IT CLEAR HE THINKS THE FILM'S SUBJECT IS CURRENT AND QUITE PERSONAL
46sc040e <NOISE> BULLION DEALERS SAY THE FIVE HOUSES FIXING THE GOLD PRICE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF THE MARKET AND REQUIREMENTS OF BRITISH FINANCIAL LEGISLATION <NOISE>
46sc040f <NOISE> AS A GROUP THE FIVE BULLION FIRMS TRANSACT LESS BUSINESS THAN OUTSIDE MARKET MAKERS SEVERAL LONDON BULLION TRADERS SAY

46sc040k THE OPPOSITION IS ALREADY ROLLING

46sc040m <NOISE> <NOISE> TEDDY KENNEDY HIMSELF HAS TESTIFIED THAT JUDGE BORK'S APPEARANCE MEANS THE END IS NEAR
46sc040n IF RONALD REAGAN WANTS ROBERT BORK CONFIRMED HE WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE CHOICE TO THE ONE THESE GROUPS ARE TRYING TO FORCE ON UNDECIDED SENATORS
46sc040o THAT MEANS MR. REAGAN HAS TO EXPLAIN CLEARLY WHY AMERICAN SOCIETY WILL BENEFIT IF JUDGES SUCH AS ROBERT BORK APPLY THE R- LAW IN A NEUTRAL MANNER
46sc040p <NOISE> HE WILL HAVE TO POINT OUT WHY S- MANY OF THE LONG HELD GRIEVANCES OF THE ELECTORATE RESULT WHEN UNELECTED JUDGES MANUFACTURE NEW LAWS
46sc040t PET OWNERS OFTEN CALL A PET PSYCHIC BECAUSE A PET IS SICK AND THEY WANT A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF HOW IT'S FEELING
46sc040u AND SOME PET PSYCHICS CLAIM THEY CAN CHAT WITH PETS FROM A DISTANCE
46sc040v FOR EXAMPLE GAY TRAVERS A FORMER PUBLICIST CALLED PET PSYCHIC PENELOPE SMITH WHEN HER CAT SEBASTIAN WAS VERY ILL
46sc040w <NOISE> MS. SMITH TOLD HER TO HANG UP WHILE THE PSYCHIC TALKED TO SEBASTIAN
46sc040x THREE MINUTES LATER SHE CALLED BACK WITH SOME BAD NEWS
46sc0414 NEWSPAPERS' COSTS ARE UP SHARPLY THIS YEAR LARGELY BECAUSE OF HIGHER NEWSPRINT PRICES THE INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST COST BEHIND LABOR EXPENSES
46sc0415 SINCE OCTOBER NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX PRICES HAVE RISEN THREE TIMES BY A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWENTY ONE PERCENT
46sc0416 NEWSPAPERS HAVE RESPONDED BY USING LIGHTER WEIGHT PAPER TRIMMING PAGE SIZE AND CUTTING THE SPACE FOR NEWS
46sc0417 MEANWHILE CIVIL RICO CONTINUES TO ATTRACT PLAINTIFFS WHO WANT TO TURN GENERAL BUSINESS DISPUTES THAT BELONG IN STATE COURTS INTO FEDERAL OFFENSES
46sc0418 FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL CONSORTIUM OF CONTRACTORS WHO CONSULTED ME HAD SUBMITTED THE LOW BID FOR A LARGE MARINA TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON LAKE MICHIGAN
46sc0419 THE SECOND LOWEST BIDDER RECENTLY FILED A CIVIL RICO ACTION <NOISE> CLAIMING THAT MISREPRESENTATIONS WERE MADE BY THE SUCCESSFUL BIDDERS USING THE TELEPHONE THEREBY COMMITTING FEDERAL WIRE FRAUD

46tc0201 ONE PROBLEM WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNPOPULAR NEW W. FOUR FORM IS THAT THE I. R. S. FAILED TO TEST IT ADEQUATELY
46tc0202 IN FACT THE FORM WASN'T SHOWN TO THE PUBLIC AT ALL
46tc0203 IT WAS PRESENTED ONLY TO THE I. R. S. EMPLOYEES IN TWO OF THE AGENCY'S SERVICE CENTERS
46tc0204 OFFICIALS SUGGEST THAT THESE CLERICAL NON TECHNICAL WORKERS REALLY AREN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC
46tc0205 STILL MR. GIBBS CONCEDES THAT THE AGENCY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SOUGHT A WIDER VIEW
46tc0206 MR. JOYNES WILL OVERSEE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING UNITS AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND STAFF SUPPORT SERVICES THE COMPANY SAID
46tc0207 THE SPOKESMAN WOULDN'T COMMENT AS TO WHETHER MR. JOYNES MIGHT SUCCEED MR. DAY AS CHAIRMAN
46tc0208 MR. DAY MUST RETIRE AT AGE SIXTY FIVE
46tc0209 UNDER THE FEDERAL RAILWAY LABOR ACT THE REJECTION TRIGGERED A THIRTY DAY COOLING OFF PERIOD THAT STARTED YESTERDAY
46tc020a IF AMERICAN AND ITS UNION CAN'T REACH A SETTLEMENT BY THEN THE AIRLINE CAN IMPOSE ITS LATEST CONTRACT *OFFER* OR LOCK OUT ITS FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
46tc020b THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ALSO WOULD BE FREE TO STRIKE BUT IT SAID IT DOESN'T PLAN TO DO SO
46tc020c <NOISE> THE LASTEST DISCLOSURES ARE AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT PROBE
46tc020d ALREADY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS ACCUSED DELTA AIRLINES AND EASTERN AIRLINES OF ENGAGING IN UNREALISTIC SCHEDULING AT ATLANTA'S HARTSFIELD AIRPORT
46tc020e THE CARRIERS DENY THIS BUT THE GOVERNMENT HAS EXPANDED ITS PROBE
46tc020f <NOISE> IT HAS ASKED SEVERAL OTHER AIRLINES TO TURN OVER THEIR ON TIME RECORDS AT DALLAS FORT WORTH CHICAGO'S O'HARE AND BOSTON'S LOGAN AIRPORTS
46tc020g ALONG WITH HIS PARTNER PHIL DILEO MR. KELLNER HAS BEEN REGARDED AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST MONEYMAKERS

46tc020w WALL STREET ANALYSTS LOOK TO THE INTEREST IN HOUSTON BASED *ENRON* CORP.'S OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS AS A GAUGE OF LIKELY INTEREST IN TENNECO'S PROPERTIES
46tc020x IN LATE APRIL ENRON AN INTEGRATED NATURAL GAS CONCERN PUT OIL AND GAS ASSETS UP FOR SALE
46tc020y <NOISE> ANALYSTS VALUED THOSE PROPERTIES AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND ONE SAID ENRON HAS RECEIVED ABOUT TWENTY OFFERS

46tc0214 I JUST CHECKED THIS MORNING HE SAID
46tc0215 <NOISE> BIDS WERE DOWN A QUARTER TO A HALF A POINT AND I'M TOLD THEY'RE NOW STARTING TO COME BACK

46tc0217 VOLUME IS NO DIFFERENT
46tc0218 THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER
46tc0219 SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT
46tc021a EVER SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE THREE AND A HALF YEARS AGO MR. GORBACHEV HAS SOUGHT TO INCREASE FOREIGN TRADE'S MEAGER SHARE OF THE SOVIET ECONOMY
46tc021b RATHER THAN SIMPLY IMPORT MORE WESTERN GOODS HE WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE MACHINERY AND KNOW HOW TO ENABLE THE SOVIETS TO MAKE THE GOODS THEMSELVES
46tc021c <NOISE> TO DO SO HE OPENED UP THE ECONOMY TO FOREIGN CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT BY PERMITTING JOINT VENTURES
46tc0304 THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN
46tc0305 WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON
46tc0306 BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS
46tc030e <NOISE> SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT CHUN HAS CHOSEN ROH TAE WOO HEAD OF THE RULING PARTY TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR WHEN CHUN'S TERM ENDS IN FEBRUARY
46tc030f THE NOMINATION WHICH ENDED MONTHS OF SPECULATION ABOUT SUCCESSION <NOISE> MEANS ROH IS CERTAIN TO BE ME- NAMED NEXT WEEK AS A DEMOCRATIC JUSTICE PARTY'S CANDIDATE
46tc030g HIS ELECTION IS ALMOST GUARANTEED
46tc030h <NOISE> SELLING THE CANADIAN BUSINESS WILL HELP T. L. C. GROUP COMPLETE ITS FINANCING ON THE REST OF BEATRICE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
46tc030i T. L. C. GROUP SAID YESTERDAY THAT IT HAS A FIRM COMMITMENT FROM DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INC. ITS INVESTMENT BANKER TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION
46tc030j A DREXEL SPOKESMAN SAID HE EXPECTS THE FINANCING TO COME THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BANK LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS
46tc030k DREXEL FINANCED THE KOHLBERG KRAVIS BUY OUT OF BEATRICE LAST YEAR
46tc030p ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE GOING PRIVATE IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT
46tc030q BUT ANALYSTS SAID MANAGEMENT WOULDN'T PREFER SUCH A PLAN BECAUSE IT WOULD MEAN CURTAILING THE COMPANY'S AMBITIOUS STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM
46tc030r IN A LEVERAGED BUY OUT A SMALL GROUP OF INVESTORS ACQUIRES A COMPANY IN A TRANSACTION FINANCED LARGELY WITH BORROWING
46tc030s <NOISE> ULTIMATELY THE DEBT IS PAID WITH FUNDS GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S OPERATIONS OR THE SALE OF ITS ASSETS

46tc031b <NOISE> HOWEVER JOHN MENDELSON CHIEF MARKET ANALYST AT DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS BELIEVES SUCH A SLUMP COULD HAPPEN
46tc031c I THINK YOU WOULD GO BACK TO NORMAL TURNOVER LEVELS IN A BEAR MARKET
46tc031d YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR TO SEE A REAL DULL LOUSY MARKET
46tc031e TURNOVER LEVEL THAT YEAR SIXTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT
46tc0401 THAT DECISION CAME EASILY
46tc0402 NOW HE'S WORKING AMID THE METAL FOLDING CHAIRS IN HIS TRANSITION OFFICE IN THE AUSTERE CHAMBER OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE
46tc0403 HIS FIRST BUDGET MUST GO TO THE PRINTER TWO DAYS AFTER HE'S INAUGURATED

46yc020k BUT I EXPECT THE DOLLAR TO CONTINUE FALLING AND THAT WILL ACCELERATE INFLATION PRESSURES
46yc020l THE BEST NUMBERS ON INFLATION ARE BEHIND US

46yc0215 THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE
46yc0216 BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING
46yc0217 WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT TO REPLY
46yc021d NINE MONTH RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR NET LOSS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF TRUCKING OPERATIONS
46yc021e ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TRUCKING CHARGE WAS TAKEN IN THE THIRD QUARTER

46yc030b THE SUIT WHICH ALSO NAMES THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AS DEFENDANTS SAYS THE DIRECTORS HAVE GIVEN PERSONAL GAIN A PRIORITY OVER THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS
46yc030c A SECOND SUIT BY MOSHE J. SCHWARTZ JEFFREY ABRAMS STANLEY HEINEMAN AND JAMES T. CAIN CONTAINS COMPARABLE CHARGES
46yc030d EARLIER AT LEAST TWO OF THOSE SAME PLAINTIFFS FILED A SUIT OVER THE ANTAR STOCK SALES
46yc030l AN F. T. C. SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT
46yc030m THE INVESTIGATION WAS FIRST REPORTED IN F. T. C. WATCH A PUBLICATION ABOUT REGULATORY MATTERS
46yc030n REACHED IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT MR. TRUMP CONFIRMED THAT THE F. T. C. HAD MADE THE REQUEST

46yc030y BUT HE ADDED SUCH ACTION COULD LEAD TO LEGAL REPRISALS
46yc030z BOTH SIDES HAVE WORKED HARD AND SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN REALIZED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS S:AID MESSRS.
46yc0310 SHULTZ AND SHEVARDNADZE IN A JOINT STATEMENT LAST NIGHT
46yc0311 BUT MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE
46yc0316 BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS
46yc0317 MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS
46yc0318 INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS
46yc0319 THE SCENE THE ANNUAL NORMAN MAILER COCKTAIL PARTY AND FIST FIGHT
46yc031a CANDICE BERGEN AND WOODY ALLEN HAD JUST JOINED A GROUP OF PSEUDO INTELLECTUALS AND WERE RAMBLING WITH THE BEST OF THEM

46yc031c THE OTHER NON WINNERS MOST NOTABLY EXXON WERE IN MANY WAYS AS NOTEWORTHY AS THE WINNERS <NOISE>
46yc031d IT IS BELIEVED THAT EXXON WAS OUTBID FOR SEVERAL RESERVE PACKAGES LEAVING IT WITH A LOT OF CASH THAT COULD STILL BE EARMARKED FOR ACQUISITIONS
46yc031e AT THE HOUSTON PETROLEUM CLUB INDUSTRY OFFICIALS COULDN'T EAT LUNCH OF LATE WITHOUT DISCUSSING SPECULATION THAT EXXON WAS GOING TO WALK AWAY WITH ALL OF THE TENNECO PROPERTIES
46yc031f AN EXXON SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WAS COMPANY POLICY NOT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING TO DO WITH ACQUISITIONS
46yc0409 SO STRANGE IS THE SITUATION THAT ONE HOLLY DIRECTOR HAS PROPOSED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME TO FANTASY SUGAR COMPANY
46yc040a HE SAYS THAT COULD ENTICE SHAMROCK BECAUSE OF ITS DISNEY CONNECTION TO BUY THE COMPANY
46yc040b JUST THINK OF HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE ON THE MOVIE RIGHTS HE ADDS
46yc040k WHERE CAN WE FIND SOME CLUES TO THE ANSWER OR AT LEAST A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION
46yc040l I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE LOOK AT THE ONE MARXIST LENINIST STATE THAT ALREADY HAS GONE QUITE FAR DOWN THE REVISIONIST ROAD
46yc040m I REFER TO THE CURIOUSLY NEGLECTED INSTANCE OF YUGOSLAVIA
46yc040n OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
46yc040o THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
46yc040p WE'LL SEE
46yc040q WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
46yc040u SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS
46yc040v THIS PROVISION WON'T RAISE ANY MONEY IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SENATOR BENTSEN WANTED SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW A QUICKER END TO THE DIESEL TAX COLLECTION

46yc0414 DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS
46yc0415 ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR
46yc0416 WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S.
46yc0417 MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS
46yc0418 IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET
46yc0419 INVESTORS TAKING PART IN THE FINANCING WILL LEND VENEZUELA ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN EXCHANGE FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW YORK TRUST FUND
46yc041a THOSE PAYMENTS WILL BE SENT WHEN THE FINANCING IS COMPLETED WHICH IS EXPECTED IN MID DECEMBER

46zc020c THE TOY BUSINESS IS RIPE FOR SOME MARKETING INNOVATION AFTER TWO YEARS OF RELATIVELY FLAT SALES SAYS RICK ANGUILLA EDITOR OF THE TOY AND HOBBY WORLD MAGAZINE
46zc020d IF TYCO SUCCEEDS OTHERS WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW

47yc030p HARRY TRUMAN WHISTLE STOPPED THE COUNTRY IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT CAMPAIGNING AGAINST A PAROCHIAL DO NOTHING CONGRESS THAT WOULD NOT ENACT HIS LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
47yc030q HE STRUCK A CHORD IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOT ONLY WINNING A STUNNING UPSET BUT ALSO DEFEATING SCORES OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN THE PROCESS
47yc030r TRUMAN RECOGNIZED THAT A PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IS NOT JUST A RACE AMONG CANDIDATES BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE GREAT ISSUES SUCH AS THE PROPER SEPARATION OF POWERS
47yc030s THE CONTEST THEN ISN'T IDEOLOGICAL
47yc030t IT'S CHARACTER PERSONALITY EXPERIENCE
47yc030u IT'S CULTURAL AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE

47yc0403 ON THIS THE MATTER IS LIKELY TO TURN
47yc0404 NOT ON WHETHER THE SHIPMENTS WERE A GOOD *IDEA* OR ON WHETHER LAWYERS CAN FIND SOME LAW THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN
47yc0405 BUT ON WHETHER PRESIDENT REAGAN TOLD THE TRUTH WHEN HE DENIED KNOWING
47yc0406 INTERCO SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT ITS INTERCO SUBSIDIARY INCORPORATED UNIT TERMINATED ITS TENDER OFFER FOR ALL LANE COMMON SHARES AT FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE

47zc0302 THE TRUST FUND WHICH IS FINANCED BY *TICKET* AND FUEL TAXES HELPS PAY FOR F. A. A. OPERATIONS AND PROVIDES GRANTS TO AIRPORTS
47zc0303 SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT AIRPORT OPERATORS AS A CONDITION OF ACCEPTING THE GRANTS AGREE TO GIVE UP SOME AUTHORITY IN MAKING NOISE RULES
47zc0304 <NOISE> RAYTHEON DENIED THAT IT'S FREELY GIVING AWAY JOBS

47zc030b BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME

488c021h AS FOR HIMSELF MR. KEEFE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE'S LEAVING HIS POST IN DECEMBER

499c040x IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND AGAIN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE DONATED TEN PERCENT INTERESTS IN FORTY FOUR ART WORKS TO CARNEGIE'S MUSEUM
499c040y EACH GIFT ENTITLED IT TO POSSESSION FOR A PROPORTIONAL PART OF A YEAR BUT THE MUSEUM DIDN'T EXERCISE ITS RIGHT
499c040z IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WINOKUR DONATED HIS REMAINING EIGHTY PERCENT INTEREST IN FIVE WORKS THE MUSEUM THEN TOOK THOSE FIVE
499c0410 WINOKUR VALUED THE ART HIMSELF AND TOOK PROPORTIONAL CHARITABLE DEDUCTIONS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS
499c0414 INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE
499c0415 FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES
499c0416 PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES
499c0417 THE IMPROVEMENT IN SEPTEMBER'S TRADE DEFICIT MOSTLY CAME ON THE EXPORT SIDE
499c0418 BUT BECAUSE OF THE POSTAL STRIKE THE DEADLINE FOR REPORTING EXPORTS WAS EXTENDED BY TWO DAYS
499c0419 THAT DATA WAS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF PRECIOUS STONES AND AIRCRAFT RELATED ITEMS REPORTED IN SEPTEMBER
499c041a NOW QUICK RECOGNITION OF LOSSES IS NOT ONLY GOOD INVESTMENT STRATEGY BUT GOOD ECONOMIC STRATEGY
499c041b FULL DEDUCTIBILITY WOULD PROMOTE MOBILITY OF CAPITAL AND EFFICIENT PRICING OF ASSETS
499c041c IT WOULD OBVIOUSLY PROMOTE MORE VENTURE CAPITAL WITH HIGH GAINS AND HIGH RISKS
499c041d MERE INDEXING BY CONTRAST WOULD HELP THE BIG AND DULL INVESTMENTS WITH LOW RISKS AND HUMDRUM REWARDS
499c041e BUT IF FULL DEDUCTIBILITY OF LOSSES WOULD BE GOOD FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IT WOULD BE BAD IN TWO OTHER WAYS
49yc020a HEADING THE LIST IS HONGKONG BANK WHICH IS BUYING OUT THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS OF MARINE MIDLAND BANK ITS PRINCIPAL U. S. SUBSIDIARY FOR EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
49yc020b JOHN GRAY A HONGKONG BANK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CONFIRMED THAT THE BANK IS SHOPPING FOR A EUROPEAN ACQUISITION BUT MAINTAINS THAT NO SPECIFIC TARGET IS IN SIGHT YET
49yc020c EUROPE IS WHERE THE GAP IS IN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS HE SAID
49yc020h CLEARLY SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN EUROPE
49yc020i IT ISN'T THAT THE WALL IS ABOUT TO FALL ANY TIME SOON
49yc020j BUT THE SERIOUSNESS WITH WHICH SERIOUS EUROPEANS DISCUSS THE PROSPECT VIVIDLY UNDERSCORES THE IMPACT ON WESTERN EUROPE OF MR. GORBACHEV AND HIS REFORM POLICIES
49yc020k YOU DIDN'T HAVE PEOPLE HITTING THE SILKS ON THIS SAID JOHN KEEFE AN ANALYST FOR DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED NEW YORK
49yc020l YOU HAD TO EXPECT HIGHER REDEMPTIONS GIVEN ALL THE DIFFICULTY IN THE MARKET
49yc020m BUT IT WAS CONTAINED FAIRLY WELL
49yc020v WHO'S RIGHT
49yc020w IN SOME RESPECTS THEY ALL ARE BUT THE BLAME DOESN'T REST ON OSHA'S SHOULDERS ALONE
49yc020x THE AGENCY HAS COME UNDER FIRE FOR DOING TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE FROM THE DAY ITS DOORS OPENED ON CONSTITUTION AVENUE SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO
49yc020y THE REALITY IS THAT OSHA'S EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN PINCHED BY BUDGET AND STAFF CUTS AND ITS GRASP ON BUSINESS LOOSENED BY THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION'S DEREGULATORY SHOCK TROOPS
49yc021c COMPANIES LISTED BELOW REPORTED QUARTERLY PROFIT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE AVERAGE OF ANALYSTS' ESTIMATES
49yc021d THE COMPANIES ARE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST THREE ANALYSTS AND HAD A MINIMUM FIVE CENT CHANGE IN ACTUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE
49yc021e ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL RESULTS INVOLVING LOSSES ARE OMITTED
49yc0304 DEMOCRATS HAVE THE CREDIBILITY ON THE BUDGET ISSUE ASSERTS KIRK O'DONNELL PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR NATIONAL POLICY A DEMOCRATIC THINK TANK
49yc0305 NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE RECORD
49yc0306 FAILURE TO COME THROUGH WITH A DEFICIT CUTTING PLAN HE ADDS WOULD MEAN AN OPPORTUNITY LOST
49yc030a MOST OF THE LOAN WOULD BE USED TO REIMBURSE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IMPORTERS FOR GOODS THEY WOULD IMPORT AND THEN INCORPORATE INTO PRODUCTS THAT COULD BE EXPORTED
49yc030b THE LOAN WOULD BE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS INCLUDING THREE YEARS OF GRACE AND CARRY A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE TIED TO THE BANK'S BORROWING COSTS
49yc030c THE RATE CURRENTLY STANDS AT SEVEN POINT NINE TWO PERCENT
49yc030d OBVIOUSLY I HAVE TO TELL MY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HARM YOU'RE DOING TO YOURSELF BY MAKING PRODUCTS OF INSUFFICIENT QUALITY
49yc030e MR. LEVY SAYS
49yc030f YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH
49yc030g THEN A YOUNG MAN APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY
49yc030h NO DELIVERY TODAY HE SAYS
49yc030i I TALKED TO THE MANAGER
49yc030j THE WOMEN SHRUG AND GO HOME
49yc030r FINE ANSWERED HIS FRIEND JOHN REILLY
49yc030s WHO CAN YOU TELL
49yc030t CERTAINLY NOT THE PUBLIC MR. REILLY NOW SAYS WITH A CHUCKLE
49yc030u GOD YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT DIDN'T KNOW
49yc030v C. P. I. IS A CLOSELY OWNED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST WITH ABOUT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS
49yc030w ITS SHAREHOLDERS INCLUDE SOME OF THE NATION'S LARGEST PENSION FUNDS
49yc030x C. P. I. ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE LITIGATION BUT SOME OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY LOVE TO SLOW DOWN THE ACTIVITY IN LEVERAGED TAKEOVERS
49yc031a BUY BACKS HELPED CLEAR UP LATIN AMERICAN DEBT PROBLEMS IN THE LATE NINETEEN THIRTIES
49yc031b IN MARCH BOLIVIA BOUGHT BACK JUST UNDER HALF ITS SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR BANK DEBT AT ELEVEN CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF DEBT
49yc0401 CLARK SAID FRIDAY IT WAS INFORMED BY BARRIS THAT IT OWNED ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF CLARK'S STOCK AND INTENDED TO ACQUIRE A LARGER STAKE
49yc0402 GIANT ALSO SAID LAST WEEK THAT IT HELD CLARK SHARES BUT IT DIDN'T DISCLOSE HOW MANY
49yc0403 GIANT AND CLARK SAID THEY EACH MAY EVENTUALLY ACQUIRE FIFTEEN PERCENT OR MORE OF CLARK'S SHARES
49yc0404 WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT WORKED
49yc0405 IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
49yc0406 IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
49yc040g INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH SOME DEMOCRATS ARE WARMING TO THE IDEA
49yc040h PRIVATIZATION OFTEN IS SIMPLY GOOD MANAGEMENT SENSE
49yc040i IT NO LONGER REPRESENTS JUST AN IDEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT SAYS DAVID LINOWES A DEMOCRAT WHO CHAIRS PRESIDENT REAGAN'S COMMISSION ON PRIVATIZATION <NOISE> WHICH ISSUES ITS REPORT NEXT MONTH
49yc040j ADDS DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE DENNIS ECKART OF OHIO WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES AND BETTER WAYS TO PROVIDE SERVICES
49yc040k THE BASIC DEMOCRATIC RESPONSE UNTIL NOW HAS BEEN DROP DEAD BUT I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE
49yc040l SOME DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT MAY GET SOME OF HIS PRIVATIZATION INITIATIVES ENACTED BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE
49yc040m ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO REMAIN POOR BECAUSE YOU WANT TO STUDY TROPICAL ANIMALS
49yc040n IS YOUR STUDY MORE IMPORTANT THAN FILLING THE EMPTY STOMACHS OF POOR PEOPLE
49yc040o ARE MALAYSIANS EXPECTED TO LOSE MILLIONS OF POUNDS SO THAT YOU CAN STUDY ANIMALS
49yc0410 WOODS A LEADER IN THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY FOR THIRTY YEARS SET THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STATION AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE
49yc0411 HE PAID WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH
49yc0412 THE COURT CANNOT UNDO HIS BAD BARGAIN THE COURT RULED
49yc0413 UNITED ALSO DISPUTED CONTINEN:TAL'S ASSERTION THAT IT WOULD OFFER LOWER FARES
49yc0414 A SPOKESMAN SAID UNITED HAS TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO REDUCE FARES TO JAPAN BUT HAS BEEN OPPOSED BY THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WHICH FEARED INCREASED COMPETITION FOR ITS NATIONAL CARRIERS
49yc0415 FARES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE CHANGED ONLY THROUGH BILATERAL AGREEMENT
49yc0419 THE DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE OPERATOR SAID THE CHARGE WILL REFLECT A WRITE DOWN OF FIXED ASSETS <NOISE> INVENTORY DISPOSAL AND SEVERANCE PAY IN RELATION TO THE STORE CLOSING
49yc041a THE STORE WHICH HAS ABOUT FORTY EMPLOYEES WILL CLOSE IN EARLY JANUARY
49yc041b THE COMPANY SAID DUE TO THE STORE'S ABOVE AVERAGE SIZE AND THE LEVEL OF SALES VOLUME IT HAS DEVELOPED <NOISE> THE STORE HAS NOT BEEN PROFITABLE
49yc041c NEVERTHELESS THE TIGERS HAVE CAUGHT NEW STADIUM FEVER CITING A SHORTAGE OF PREMIUM SEATS AND A MAINTENANCE TAB THAT RUNS FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY
49yc041d WHILE SOME OF BASEBALL'S BEST SEATS ARE HERE SO ARE SOME OF THE WORST WITH MANY OBSTRUCTED VIEWS
49yc041e NEARLY HALF OF ITS SEATS ARE IN THE BLEACHERS WITH ONLY TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BETWEEN FOUL POLES THE FEWEST IN THE MAJORS
49zc0208 <NOISE> MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS ON THE BIG BOARD COMPARED WITH A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION TUESDAY
49zc0209 DESPITE THE NEW HIGHS IN THE CLOSELY WATCHED MARKET BAROMETERS THE ADVANCING ISSUES NEVER HAD AN IMPRESSIVE LEAD OVER DECLINERS DURING THE SESSION
49zc020a BY THE CLOSE THE TALLY STOOD AT EIGHT HUNDRED TEN GAINERS AND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN DECLINERS
49zc020b ELSINORE CORPORATION'S ATLANTIS OPERATING UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN OF THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY CODE REPORTED THE LARGEST DROP IN WINNINGS
49zc020c ATLANTIS WINNINGS FELL TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
49zc020d UNDER CHAPTER ELEVEN THE CASINO IS PROTECTED FROM CREDITORS WHILE IT WORKS OUT A PLAN TO PAY DEBT
49zc020i BRANIFF CHAIRMAN JAY A. PRITZKER AND HIS FAMILY CONTROL NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF BRANIFF'S VOTING STOCK
49zc020j BRANIFF'S PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE PAN AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS WOULD GIVE PAN AM CORP. COMMON SHAREHOLDERS A FIFTY FIVE PERCENT INTEREST IN THE MERGED COMPANY
49zc020k BRANIFF SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT AND PAN AM'S UNION EMPLOYEES TWENTY PERCENT IN EXCHANGE FOR WAGE SAVINGS OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FOUR YEARS
49zc020o POPULATION SHIFTS HAVE REDISTRIBUTED POWER WITHIN STATES AND BETWEEN REGIONS
49zc020p FAR REACHING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES HAVE ALTERED VOTER TURNOUT AND LOYALTIES

49zc021c S. AND P'S EVENT RISK COVENANT RANKINGS WHICH WERE STARTED LAST MONTH HAVE FIVE CATEGORIES
49zc021d <NOISE> E. THREE STANDS MIDWAY
49zc021e TRADERS HAVE SAID THE BOWATER BONDS WAS THE BEST RECEIVED DEAL IN THE PAST TWO SESSIONS BECAUSE OF A STRONG INVESTOR DEMAND FOR EVENT RISK PROTECTION
49zc0308 NOW TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOXES DATING BACK TO NINETEEN OH NINE ARE ON DISPLAY BENEATH TRACK LIGHTING IN A SPECIAL ROOM IN HIS HOUSE
49zc0309 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY OTHER BOXES ARE IN THE GARAGE
49zc030a THEY ARE OF A MORE RECENT VINTAGE AND MR. COOK IS WAITING FOR THEM TO APPRECIATE IN VALUE
49zc030b GENERAL SECORD SAID HE WAS STUNNED TO LEARN THAT DAY OF ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S RESIGNATION AND COLONEL NORTH'S FIRING
49zc030d HE SAID COLONEL NORTH MET HIM THERE AND RECEIVED PHONE CALLS FROM PRESIDENT REAGAN AND VICE PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH THANKING HIM FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE GOVERNMENT
49zc030e THE IMPROVED RESULTS STEM LARGELY FROM GOLD SALES AT THE COMPANY'S GOLD BAR OPERATIONS IN NEVADA WHERE PRODUCTION BEGAN IN JANUARY
49zc030f WE THINK WE CAN C- CAN SUSTAIN PRODUCTION OF FORTY FIVE THOUSAND TO FIFTY THOUSAND OUNCES ANNUALLY FOR AT LEAST TEN YEARS MR. WEAVER SAID IN AN INTERVIEW
49zc030g ATLAS ALSO CONTROLS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES CONTIGUOUS TO GOLD BAR AND EXPLORATION EFFORTS ARE BEING EXPANDED
49zc030l INACOMP COMPUTER CENTERS INC. ANNOUNCED THE OFFERING OF ONE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SH- COMMON SHARES AT EIGHT DOLLARS POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE CENTS EACH
49zc030m THE TROY MICHIGAN BASED MARKETER OF MICROCOMPUTERS AND RELATED PRODUCTS SAID THE PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REPAY DEBT
49zc030n SALOMON BROTHERS INC. IS THE LEAD UNDERWRITER
49zc030o INACOMP SAID THE UNDERWRITERS HAVE BEEN GRANTED AN OVERALLOTMENT OPTION TO PURCHASE AS MANY AS AN ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SHARES
49zc030p IN OVER THE COUNTER TRADING YESTERDAY THE COMPANY'S SHARES CLOSED AT EIGHT DOLLARS TWENTY FIVE CENTS DOWN TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS
49zc030u TO PUNISH CURRENCY SPECULATORS THE GOVERNMENT IS ALLOWING PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE A MAXIMUM OF TEN MILLION OLD CORDOBAS
49zc030v ANYTHING OVER THAT CAN'T BE EXCHANGED BUT MUST BE DEPOSITED IN A BANK ACCOUNT
49zc030w THE MOVES TOOK EFFECT YESTERDAY
49zc0310 THAT GROWTH CAME IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF WHICH PROMPTED A FLOOD OF MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS
49zc0311 IT ALSO REFLECTED GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO <NOISE> STIMULATE DOMESTIC SPENDING
49zc0312 THE HOUSING BOOM IN TURN TRIGGERED HEAVY CONSUMER SPENDING ON HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH AIDED THE STRONG SECOND HALF ECONOMIC EXPANSION
49zc0313 INFLATION ADJUSTED GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT GREW TWO PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM FROM THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS AND ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER
49zc0314 MR. BREGMAN SAID IN AN INTERVIEW THAT MR. GILLET TE- TELEPHONED HIM FRIDAY WITH THIRTY TWO DOLLARS A SHARE OFFER FOR THE PARTNERSHIP'S STOCK
49zc0315 HE SAID HE DECLINED BECAUSE THE OFFER WAS TOO LOW AND BECAUSE IT WASN'T BEING MADE TO OTHER HOLDERS
49zc0316 THE LETTER FILED YESTERDAY SAID THE PARTNERSHIP WOULDN'T CONSIDER GREENMAIL PROPOSALS
49zc0317 GREENMAIL REFERS TO A COMPANY'S BUYING BACK STOCK AT A HIGHER THAN MARKET PRICE
49zc031b I DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BAUSCH AND LOMB CASE AND THE APPLE CASE
49zc0401 AND WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WAVING THE COMPETITIVENESS FLAG WON'T THE ARGUMENT GET A LITTLE SHOPWORN
49zc0402 SAYS MR. KAY IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT IMPROVING U. S. COMPETITIVENESS ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS HAS TO BE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
49zc0403 BUT YES TO THE EXTENT THIS TOWN BECOMES CYNICAL ABOUT COMPETITIVENESS BEING USED TO COVER EVERYTHING ON FOUR LEGS IT WILL HURT US
49zc0407 <NOISE> PUBLISHING SO CALLED BACKLIST BOOKS THAT ARE KEPT IN PRINT FOR YEARS ON END HAS SOME ADVANTAGES OVER PUBLISHING BEST SELLERS
49zc0408 A GOOD FISHING BOOK WILL NEVER MATCH A JACKIE COLLINS NOVEL IN TOTAL SALES
49zc0409 BUT IT WILL OUTLIVE HER RACY FICTION WITH ITS FICKLE READERS
49zc040a PUBLISHERS WILL DUMP MOST OF THIS YEAR'S BEST SELLERS ON REMAINDER TABLES NEXT YEAR WHERE THEY MAY FETCH AS LITTLE AS A DOLLAR APIECE
49zc040i I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW WELL THE SCENTS HAVE DONE ON THE MARKET SAID THOMAS CONLEY EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FISHING TACKLE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
49zc040j BUT THEN AGAIN ANY TIME YOU GET A PRODUCT THAT CALLS ATTENTION TO FISHING IT'S GOOD AS A WHOLE
49zc040k SOME CALL WHATEVER IT IS A GIMMICK WHILE OTHERS SAY IT'S THE BEST THING SINCE THE ROD AND REEL
49zc040l EITHER WAY IT GETS PEOPLE TO TRY IT
49zc040p THE COMPANY SAID IT INTENDS TO PURCHASE THOSE SHARES TENDERED AT OR BELOW TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE
49zc040q SHARES TENDERED AT HIGHER PRICES WILL BE RETURNED TO HOLDERS TORCHMARK SAID
49zc040r IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING FRIDAY TORCHMARK CLOSED AT TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE UP A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE
49zc040u ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE ARE KNOTTY PROBLEMS FOR THE U. S. FROM LATIN AMERICA NICARAGUA AND PANAMA TO THE MIDDLE EAST
49zc040w NEITHER COMPANY HAS DISCLOSED A POSSIBLE PRICE BUT THE PRESENCE OF TWO INTERESTED PARTIES IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT ANY BUYER WOULD HAVE TO PAY
49zc040x WELL THE COMPANY P. S. OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IS IN PLAY SAID DANIEL SCOTTO AN ANALYST AT L. F. ROTHSCHILD
49zc040y THE MORE PEOPLE INTERESTED THE HIGHER THE PRICE YOU'LL FETCH
49zc040z NEW YORK PUBLICISTS ACTUALLY ARE UPSET
49zc0410 FOR THEM AND THEIR CELEBRITY CLIENTS GETTING INTO SUZY'S COLUMN RATIFIES THEIR IMPORTANCE
49zc0411 HER COLUMN IS AMONG THE MOST WIDELY READ IN NEW YORK RIVALED ONLY BY LIZ SMITH'S
49zc041c HOW DID THE BOARD VOTE ON THE REDUCTION PLAN
49zc041d IT DIDN'T SAYS MR. MILLER
49zc041e A TWENTY TWO MEMBER EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE NOW SLASHED TO SEVEN BECAUSE OF RESIGNATIONS HANDLED THE VOTING
49zc041f THE PLAN PASSED UNANIMOUSLY
4a0c0201 TERMS WEREN'T DISCLOSED
4a0c0202 THE CONSTRUCTION HAS ALREADY BEGUN AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN LATE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
4a0c0203 FLUOR SAID THE PROJECT WILL EMPLOY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED WORKERS AT ITS PEAK LEVELS
4a0c020h U. S. AIR OPERATES PRIMARILY IN THE EAST AND MIDWEST
4a0c020i P. S. A. SERVES TWENTY NINE AIRPORTS MAINLY ON THE WEST COAST
4a0c020j THE COMBINATION WOULD CREATE THE SEVENTH LARGEST DOMESTIC AIR CARRIER
4a0c020u IN GENERAL JACKSON STRATEGISTS SAID THAT THEY ARE PLEASED WITH THE WAY THE DUKAKIS CAMPAIGN IS TREATING THEM
4a0c020v ADVISER ANN LEWIS PRAISED THE ATMOSPHERE OF RESPECT AND FAIR PLAY THAT SURROUNDED BOTH THE PLATFORM AND THE RULES DISCUSSIONS
4a0c020w WE KNEW THE MATH MR. LEWIS SAID
4a0c020x WE WANTED THE FAIREST THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO STATE OUR CASE
4a0c020y WE'VE HAD THAT
4a0c0218 THE BELLEVUE WASHINGTON TRUCK MAKER SAID TRUCK SALES IN CANADA AUSTRALIA THE UNITED KINGDOM AND MEXICO ALL SHOWED GAINS
4a0c0219 SALES OF MINING EQUIPMENT ALSO PICKED UP ALTHOUGH OIL FIELD SERVICE EQUIPMENT SALES CONTINUED TO SLUMP
4a0c021a THE COMPANY ALSO CITED A LOWER INCOME TAX RATE
4a0c0304 THE DISCLOSURES CAME IN A PROXY STATEMENT AMENDMENT FILED YESTERDAY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
4a0c0305 AS WORD OF THE FILING SPREAD TRADERS SOLD SHARES IN BOTH COMPANIES
4a0c0306 IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY EMERY SHARES CLOSED AT THIRTEEN POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE DOWN ONE POINT THREE SEVEN FIVE
4a0c0307 <NOISE> SHARES IN PUROLATOR A MINORITY INTEREST IN WHICH IS STILL IN PUBLIC HANDS FELL FIVE POINT FIVE TO TWENTY NINE POINT SEVEN FIVE
4a0c030b YOU'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS FALLOFF HERE THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET BIGGER AS WE APPROACH THE SUMMER DOLDRUMS ONE TRADER SAYS
4a0c030c HE ESTIMATES THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOLUME HAS TUMBLED FROM YEAR EARLIER LEVELS BY FORTY PERCENT SO FAR THIS MONTH AND THIRTY PERCENT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE
4a0c030d LET'S FACE IT HE SAYS WE NEED COMMISSIONS TO PAY THE BILLS
4a0c030o SINCE THOSE ROMAN DAYS OF COURSE THE JEWS HAVE BEEN THE WANDERERS OF THE EARTH
4a0c030p THERE IS HARDLY A CORNER OF IT WHERE SOME HAVE NOT SOUGHT REFUGE
4a0c030q IN MANY PLACES THEY FOUND IT BUT ONLY BRIEFLY
4a0c030r SOONER OR LATER THEY FOUND THEMSELVES STRANGERS IN THEIR NEW SOCIETY
4a0c030s AT FIRST PERHAPS THEY WERE ONLY SET ASIDE SEGREGATED IN WHERE THEY MIGHT LIVE AND WHAT WORK THEY MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO DO
4a0c0315 <NOISE> IN THE POSITION I'M IN I COULD RAISE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY IN TEN DAYS MORE THAN I WOULD NEED HE SAYS
4a0c0316 BUT I WON'T DO IT
4a0c0317 I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
4a0c0402 BUT THE DOLLAR'S TWENTY PERCENT DECLINE AGAINST THE FRENCH FRANC SINCE DECEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE COULD HAVE INFLATED THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE PRODUCTION COSTS BY ABOUT THE SAME PERCENTAGE
4a0c0404 MOST INDIANS TRAVELING TO PAKISTAN MUST DO LIKEWISE
4a0c0405 VISAS FOR EITHER COUNTRY TAKE ABOUT A MONTH TO OBTAIN
4a0c0406 INDIANS TRAVELING IN PAKISTAN AND *PAKISTANIS* VISITING INDIA MUST SPELL OUT WELL IN ADVANCE WHICH CITIES THEY PLAN TO VISIT AND REGISTER WITH THE POLICE AT EVERY STOP
4a0c0407 THEY RISK DETENTION IF THEY DEVIATE FROM THE ITINERARY
4a0c040g THAT RIGHT EXPIRES NEXT MONTH BUT TEXACO HAS ASKED JUDGE SCHWARTZBERG TO BLOCK PROPOSALS FROM ANY OTHER PARTIES UNTIL MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
4a0c040o I REGARD THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AUTO RACING AND BOXING AS ONE OF DEGREE NOT KIND WITH AUTO RACING GETTING THE WORST OF THE COMPARISON
4a0c040p IN ADDITION I FAIL TO SEE AUTO RACING IN THE MAN AGAINST MAN DRAMA THAT SPORTS SHOULD GENERATE
4a0c040q <NOISE> TOO MUCH METAL AND TOO MANY CORPORATE STICKERS GET IN THE WAY
4a0c040v BUT SEARS WASN'T ABLE TO PERSUADE MAYTAG CORPORATION AN APPLIANCE MAKER WITH A REPUTATION FOR QUALITY AND DEPENDABILITY TO START DISTRIBUTING MAYTAG PRODUCTS THROUGH SEARS STORES
4a0c040w SEARS OFFICIALS SAID TALKS ARE CONTINUING WITH NEWTON IOWA BASED MAYTAG WHICH HAS AN ESTIMATED TWELVE PERCENT SHARE OF THE U. S. APPLIANCE MARKET
4a0c040x OUR HOPE IS THAT THEY WILL SEE THE LIGHT SAID ERIC SAUNDERS A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING AT SEARS
4a0c0413 AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED HE SAID PLAYTEX APPAREL WILL HAVE TOTAL DEBT OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION
4a0c0414 *PLAYTEX* HOLDINGS' DEBT WILL APPROACH ONE BILLION DOLLARS
4a1c020o THE LEGISLATION PUTS SWISS INSIDER LAWS MORE IN LINE WITH THOSE OF OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
4a1c020p SWITZERLAND CURRENTLY ALLOWS THE INSIDER TO BE FREE BUT CAN PUNISH THOSE WHO PROFIT FROM A TIP
4a1c020q MEANWHILE AN INFORMAL PACT BETWEEN THE U. S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE SWISS BANKERS ASSOCIATION CONCERNING INSIDER TRADING INVESTIGATIONS HAS EXISTED SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO
4a1c020r THE PACT REQUIRES A CUSTOMER OF SWISS BANKS TO WAIVE SECRECY RIGHTS IF THE CUSTOMER IS LINKED TO AN INSIDER TRADING CASE BY THE S. E. C.
4a1c0212 THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE BILL THAT AMERICA'S PARTNERS FIND NO LESS DISCONCERTING
4a1c0213 COMPANIES THAT VIOLATE EXPORT CONTROLS FOR INSTANCE COULD BE BARRED FROM THE U. S. MARKET AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR FIVE YEARS
4a1c0214 ALSO PROBLEMATIC IN MY VIEW IS THAT THE U. S. WOULD CALL FOREIGN COMPANIES TO ACCOUNT FOR VIOLATIONS OF FOREIGN LAW COMMITTED ABROAD
4a1c0215 RESTRICTING THE PRESIDENT'S SCOPE FOR ACTION REGARDING IMPORTS ALSO COULD TEND TO HARDEN INTERNATIONAL FRONTS
4a1c0216 EACH DECADE SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES HAS SPAWNED A WELFARE REFORM MOVEMENT
4a1c0217 THE FIRST OF THESE IN THE FORM OF LYNDON JOHNSON'S GREAT SOCIETY LED TO A MASSIVE GROWTH OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE
4a1c0218 THE SECOND TRIED TO AMEND THE INCENTIVES OF THE SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE WORK AND FAMILY STABILITY AND TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM INCOME FOR FAMILIES
4a1c0219 THE REFORM MOVEMENT OF THE EIGHTIES COMBINES TOUGHER APPROACHES TO WORK REQUIREMENTS AND FAMILY SUPPORT WITH MORE GENEROUS AID FOR TRAINING
4a1c021a YET THE WELFARE BILL THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL SIGN INTO LAW TOMORROW CONSTITUTES ONLY A MARGINAL CHANGE IN THE SYSTEM
4a1c021b MEANWHILE POVERTY CONTINUES WELFARE DEPENDENCY INCREASES AND THE UNDERCLASS EXPANDS
4a1c021c HIS BEST PITCH IS HIS SINKER AND IT'S A GREAT ONE
4a1c021d BUT HE'S GOT TO PINPOINT IT TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE AND THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO DO INNING AFTER INNING AND GAME AFTER GAME SAID DEMPSEY
4a1c021e HE WAS ABLE TO STAY IN A GROOVE LONGER THAN ANY PITCHER I'VE SEEN
4a1c021f IT'S STUDY ATTITUDE AND CONCENTRATION AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE
4a1c021g <NOISE> ALL I KNOW IS THAT WHEREVER I PUT MY GLOVE TONIGHT THURSDAY IT'S MOSTLY WHERE THE BALL WENT
4a1c0301 <NOISE> THAT HARDLY MATTERS SAID SIR GEOFFREY NOTING THAT WITH ALL THE TRAITOR SPIES THAT PRECEDED HIM THERE WASN'T MUCH LEFT TO TELL
4a1c0302 THE POINT IS HE WAS ONE OF US
4a1c0303 HE JOINED M. FIFTEEN STRAIGHT OUT OF OXFORD
4a1c0304 BEEN IN THE CIVIL SERVICE ALL HIS LIFE
4a1c0305 HE HAS A HUGE SENSE OF HUMOR AND IS BY ALL ACCOUNTS A NICE MAN
4a1c0306 CRITICS SAY HE IS CAPTIVATED BY HIS OWN ELOQUENCE
4a1c0307 -TRUE HE SAYS SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW WHEN TO SHUT UP
4a1c0308 REGARDLESS OF WHAT POLITICAL LABEL THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDS GEORGE BUSH AS A DECENT HONEST AND LIKABLE PERSON
4a1c0309 AND MOST WOULD AGREE THAT HIS PERSONAL HISTORY HAS A STORYBOOK QUALITY ABOUT IT
4a1c030a SOMEBODY ONCE SAID GEORGE BUSH HAS LED THE LIFE THAT RONALD REAGAN PORTRAYS SAYS PETE TEELEY A LONGTIME AIDE
4a1c030d HE SAYS THAT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE DREXEL CUSTOMERS' HOLDINGS IN STALEY WERE EVER LARGE ENOUGH TO REQUIRE A THIRTEEN D. FILING
4a1c0313 THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO FRONTS
4a1c0314 ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES
4a1c0315 ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUY OUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS
4a1c0404 HE TOOK THE TAG NUMBER OF THEIR CAR MR. CLIFTON RECALLED REFERRING TO MR. MCGEE
4a1c0405 AND HE CAME AND GOT ME AND SAID HEY THIS IS THE REAL THING <NOISE>
4a1c0406 IT'S NOT A FLUKE
4a1c0407 IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE
4a1c0408 MANGA FITS NICELY INTO A LIFE STYLE THAT PROVIDES LITTLE TIME OR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY LIVE ONE'S FANTASIES
4a1c0409 FOR EXAMPLE STUDENTS WHOSE DAYS ACTUALLY ARE SPENT STUDYING BECOME COMIC BOOK SECRET AGENTS AND SOLDIERS
4a1c040a AND A FREQUENT MANGA THEME IS A BOY'S LOVE AFFAIR WITH HIS BUXOM TEACHER
4a1c040c BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT HE WILL STILL BE IN POWER WHEN THE SOVIETS OWE SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS
4a1c040d ANOTHER REFORM MINDED LEADER NIKITA KHRUSHCHEV TRIED TO KICK START THE SOVIET ECONOMY IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES AND WAS SENT PACKING
4a1c040e NEARLY TWENTY YEARS OF ECONOMIC MISMANAGEMENT FOLLOWED
4a1c040g HUNGARY BEGAN ITS FLIRTATION WITH MARKET ECONOMICS IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT YET TODAY IS IN THE MIDST OF A SEVERE DEBT CRUNCH
4a1c040k BUT THAT WAS AN ABERRATION
4a1c040l <NOISE> DICK DOESN'T GET HIGHS AND LOWS LIKE THE REST OF US SAYS D- OKLAHOMA DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN MIKE SYNAR A FRIEND AND BACKER
4a1c040m HE'S LIKE THE STAR QUARTERBACK STEADY
4a1c040n THE TEAM KNOWS HE'S THE BEST HOPE THEY'VE GOT
4a1c040o ADMIRAL CROWE ISN'T DEFENSIVE ABOUT MISTAKES
4a1c040p IF THERE'S ONE PROFESSION IN WHICH YOU CAN'T MOUNT AN ERROR FREE OPERATION IT'S THE MILITARY HE SAYS
4a1c040q IN THIS CASE THE J. C. S. CHIEF FEARED THAT CONGRESS MIGHT CURTAIL THE NAVY OPERATION IF THE U. S. REPEATEDLY LOOKED ILL PREPARED
4a1c040r I HAD REALLY UNDERESTIMATED HOW INVOLVED CONGRESS WOULD GET AND HOW DETERMINED THEY WOULD BE TO POLITICIZE IT HE SAYS
4a1c0417 BUT THE COMPANY ALSO IS SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOME BASIC STRATEGIC ERRORS

4a7c030k THUS A RECENT KIM YOUNG SAM RALLY THAT ATTRACTED A CROWD OF ONE MILLION AT HIS HOME TOWN OF PUSAN WAS A SECONDARY NEWS ITEM ON THE NIGHTLY NEWS <NOISE>
4a7c030l SEVERAL SMALLER PARTY MEETINGS ATTENDED BY MR. ROH LED THE BROADCAST
4a7c030m I. N. F. ALSO REMOVES U. S. GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISE MISSILES FROM EUROPE BUT WHAT ABOUT AIR LAUNCHED OR SEA LAUNCHED CRUISES
4a7c030n SINCE THE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS ARE SIMILAR IN ALL THREE TYPES ARE WE ALSO BANNED FROM PROVIDING THEM TO OUR ALLIES
4a7c030o CRUISES ARE ESSENTIAL OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY CAN CARRY CONVENTIONAL WARHEADS AND THUS DEFEND EUROPE WITHOUT THREATENING A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE
4a7c030p BUT THE U. S. GAVE UP ALL GROUND LAUNCHED CRUISES AS PART OF THE I. N. F. BECAUSE WE SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NUCLEAR AND CONVENTIONAL
4a7c030q AND ON MONDAY SENATOR JOE BIDEN ALREADY WAS ARGUING THAT THE SAME LOGIC SHOULD APPLY TO AIR LAUNCHED OR SEA LAUNCHED CRUISES IN THE START TALKS

4a7c040i THEY ALL TURN SIDEWAYS AND PLOP DOWN ON EACH OTHER'S LAPS
4a7c040j THEN EACH GIVES THE STRANGER SITTING IN HIS OR HER LAP A BACK MASSAGE
4a7c040s BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL
4a7c040t THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST
4a7c040u BEAUTY PAGEANTS ARE RARE HERE HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENT STILL FIXES PRICES ON MANY PRODUCTS AND STRICTLY REGULATES STORE HOURS
4a7c040y BUT EASTERN EXCLUDED A NUMBER OF HIGH TRAFFIC HUB CITIES <NOISE> FROM THE SPECIAL PROGRAM WHICH INVOLVES TRAVEL FROM SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TO DECEMBER FIFTEENTH
4a7c0410 IN ADDITION TICKETS MUST BE PURCHASED FROM AUGUST FIFTEENTH TO AUGUST TWENTY SIXTH

4a7c0412 AFTER MR. BUSH LOST TO KANSAS SENATOR ROBERT DOLE IN THE IOWA CAUCUS THE FAMILY RUSHED TO HIS RESCUE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE
4a7c0413 THEY HAD BURIED GEORGE BUSH IN THE PRESS RECALLS FORTY TWO YEAR OLD GEORGE BUSH JUNIOR
4a7c0414 IT WAS TIME TO RESURRECT HIM
4a8c0207 <NOISE> MR. BERGER CLAIMS THE PROBLEM GOES BEYOND SIMPLY RECOVERING THE COST OF IMPROVEMENTS
4a8c0208 BECAUSE THE LOFT'S BOARD'S REIMBURSEMENT ALLOWANCES ARE SO LOW HE SAYS BANKS WON'T MAKE LOANS FOR THE WORK
4a8c0209 HE SAYS HE FINANCED HIS IMPROVEMENTS BY TAKING A SECOND MORTGAGE ON ANOTHER BUILDING THAT HE OWNS
4a8c020a THE BOTTOM LINE HE SAYS IS THAT THESE BUILDINGS CANNOT BE MADE SAFE UNDER THESE RULES
4a8c020b THE JOB WILL NOT GET DONE
4a8c020i THE FATE OF MANY A. M. C. EMPLOYEES IS UNCERTAIN
4a8c020j MR. IACOCCA SAID LAST MONTH CHRYSLER MIGHT BE ABLE TO KEEP HALF OF A. M. C.'S EMPLOYEES
4a8c020k MR. CAPPY AND CHRYSLER EXECUTIVES SAID THEY STILL DON'T KNOW HOW MANY A. M. C. WORKERS WILL ULTIMATELY LOSE THEIR JOBS
4a8c020p ON THE SUBJECT OF COMPUTER RESERVATIONS SYSTEMS YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
4a8c020q <NOISE> THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR RULES GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF C. R. S. SYSTEMS LED TO PUBLICATION OF UNREALISTIC SCHEDULES BY THE AIRLINES TO GET BETTER SCREEN POSITIONS
4a8c020r THIS RESULTED IN MORE DELAYS AND A LOT OF PASSENGER FRUSTRATION
4a8c020s IN RETROSPECT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE IN C. R. S. SYSTEMS WAS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
4a8c0213 <NOISE> THE F. B. I. MEANWHILE OBTAINED TWO ADDITIONAL SEARCH WARRANTS AND IS EXPECTED TO OBTAIN OTHERS THIS WEEK
4a8c0214 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAID THE FIRST FORMAL CHARGES IN THE INQUIRY COULD COME LATE THIS SUMMER OR IN THE FALL

4a8c0216 RUBLES ARE LITTLE BILLS THE SIZE OF MONOPOLY MONEY
4a8c0217 THE THREES ARE GREEN FIVES BLUE TENS BUFF TWENTY FIVES RUST FIFTIES GREEN AGAIN
4a8c0218 LIKE MONOPOLY MONEY THEY TEND TO PILE UP SO THAT THE UNWARY TRAVELER MAY END A STAY WITH MORE THAN HE BEGAN AN ECONOMIC CRIME
4a8c0219 CHRYSLER'S SHARE OF THE U. S. CAR MARKET SLIPPED DURING THE QUARTER OF TEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT FROM ELEVEN POINT THREE PERCENT
4a8c021a THE COMPANY IS INCREASING ITS EMPHASIS ON TRUCKS WHERE ITS JEEPS AND MINIVANS ARE AMONG THE INDUSTRY'S STRONGEST SELLING VEHICLES
4a8c021b IN JUNE CHRYSLER SOLD MORE TRUCKS THAN CARS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER AND THAT PATTERN MAY CONTINUE
4a8c021c BUT THE RIDE COULD BE BUMPY
4a8c021d SOUTH KOREAN POLITICAL UNREST COULD CURB MARKET GAINS FOR ONE THING
4a8c021e ANY SEVERE SLUMP IN THE U. S. MARKET COULD DRAG DOWN THE KOREA FUND TOO
4a8c021f CURRENCY LOSSES COULD ALSO EAT INTO RETURNS THOUGH ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WILL RISE IN VALUE AGAINST THE U. S. DOLLAR
4a8c021g AND BUYING A FUND FOR MORE THAN ITS PORTFOLIO VALUE CAN BE TREACHEROUS SOME AN- ANALYSTS SAY
4a8c0301 IN NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY LEAR SIEGLER SHARES ROSE ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS TO EIGHTY THREE DOLLARS

4a8c0304 THE COURT BASED ITS RULING ON A SECTION OF THE LAW STATING THAT THE PROVISION WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE HIGHEST PRICE SHALL BE APPLICABLE
4a8c0305 THE PANEL NOTED THAT SINCE MARKET PRICES WERE FAIRLY HIGH WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED THIS PROVISION SET A CEILING ABOVE WHICH REGULATED PRICES COULDN'T RISE
4a8c0306 NOW WITH MARKET PRICES LOW IT SERVES AS A PRICE FLOOR BELOW WHICH REGULATED PRICES CAN'T DROP IT SAID

4a8c030h OTHER REPRESENTATIVES OF PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS SAY THAT ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRAWBACKS OF *REG* NEGS IS THE AMOUNT OF WORK REQUIRED USUALLY SEVERAL MONTHS
4a8c030i IT IS EXTREMELY LABOR INTENSIVE SAYS DAVID DONIGER A LAWYER OF NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL
4a8c030j PENDING LEGISLATION IN CONGRESS WOULD GIVE PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS SOME COMPENSATION FOR JOINING REG NEGS
4a8c030n IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SAYS A KEY PLAYER IN THE BATTLE
4a8c030o IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY BECAUSE GENERALE DE *BELGIQUE* IS RICH NOW
4a8c030p IT'S A PROBLEM OF CULTURE AND STYLE OF MANAGEMENT
4a8c030q NEW CAMPAIGN CO CHAIRMAN LAXALT MAY SERVE AS INTERMEDIARY WITH THE REAGANS EVEN AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUSH STILL FEELS AWKWARD TALKING TO THEM
4a8c030r SOME STRATEGISTS THINK REAGAN'S RECENT RASH OF PATENTLY PARTISAN MOVES HAS BEEN A MISTAKE
4a8c030s ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF CHIEF OF STAFF DUBERSTEIN EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INTEGRATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
4a8c030w IN DECIDING TO LEAVE JOHNSON AND SWANSON MR. SWANSON SAID THAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR A SMALLER SETTING WHERE HE COULD OFFER MORE PERSONALIZED LEGAL COUNSEL
4a8c030x HE SAID HE WILL START A SOLO PRACTICE SPECIALIZING IN FAMILY BUSINESS MATTERS AND ADVISING TRUSTEES WITH A GOAL OF EXPANDING TO AS MANY AS TEN LAWYERS
4a8c030y BOTH HE AND MR. JOHNSON SAID HIS DEPARTURE IS ON FRIENDLY TERMS
4a8c030z AT THE SAME TIME THE REGION HAS BECOME A MECCA FOR DEVELOPERS ITS RATE OF POPULATION AND JOB GROWTH HAS SLOWED LEAVING SOME MARKETS SEVERELY OVERBUILT
4a8c0310 SUCH SUN BELT HOT SPOTS AS ATLANTA NASHVILLE AND PALM BEACH COUNTY FLORIDA ARE S- ALL STRUGGLING <NOISE>
4a8c0311 <NOISE> IN THE LATTER THE OFFICE VACANCY RATE HAS HIT THIRTY TWO PERCENT AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING PERMITS ARE FORECAST TO DROP SEVENTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR
4a8c0312 ACTUALLY SOMETHING RATHER LIKE THIS DOES HAPPEN BUT ONLY AMONG CERTAIN ELITE GROUPS THAT DEBATE SUCH DETAILED ISSUES
4a8c0313 AND THE DEPTH AND OPENNESS OF THIS DEBATE UNQUESTIONABLY IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF STRENGTH IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM
4a8c0314 THE ELITES MOREOVER ARTICULATE CHOICES AND CALL A NATION TO ITS IDEALS
4a8c0315 SOME OF THE MOST THOUGHTFUL STUDENTS OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT BELIEVE THAT THE UPBRINGING AND TRAINING OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL ELITES ARE THE KEY TO THE SYSTEM'S SUCCESS
4a8c031a PURSUING A TIP POLICE SEIZED THE PAIR OF THE DRUGS WITH A STREET VALUE IN MUNICH OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
4a8c031b BUT FOLLOW UP DETECTIVE WORK AND LEADS FROM THE U. S. DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION INDICATED THIS WAS A SMALL ADVANCE SAMPLE
4a8c031c THE BIG SHIPMENT WOULD COME SIX WEEKS LATER BY SEA FROM COLOMBIA'S MEDELLIN COCAINE CARTEL
4a8c0405 BY YESTERDAY TEXACO'S EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE SECURITY ISSUE HAD TAKEN ON THE INTENSITY OF A CORPORATE SURVIVAL MISSION
4a8c0406 A HORDE OF TEXACO LITIGATORS JOINED BY THE COMPANY'S HIGHEST RANKING EXECUTIVES HAD ESTABLISHED A HEADQUARTERS IN HOUSTON THAT ONE TEXACO LAWYER DUBBED THE WAR ROOM
4a8c0407 THROUGHOUT THE DAY THEY WERE SUPPLIED WITH DATA FROM ANOTHER TEAM AT TEXACO HEADQUARTERS IN WHITE PLAINS NEW YORK
4a8c0408 I DON'T CHOOSE TO LIVE THIS WAY
4a8c0409 EATING IS MY PASTIME AND EATING IN TEXAS IS AN ADVENTURE
4a8c040a BUT LAST FALL MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO CHANGE MY DIET AT LEAST UNTIL I LOWERED MY CHOLESTEROL LEVEL
4a8c040k <NOISE> MR. MAGUIRE PHONED HIS BANK BANKERS TRUST COMPANY ONE OF NEW YORK'S BIGGEST AN IMPORTANT LENDER TO WALL STREET
4a8c040l HE ASKED FOR A THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR LOAN EVEN THOUGH HENDERSON IS ONE OF WALL STREET'S BEST CAPITALIZED SPECIALIST FIRMS
4a8c040m HE WAS STUNNED BY THE RESPONSE
4a8c040n THEY STATED THEY WERE IN NO POSITION TO MAKE COMMITMENTS MR. MAGUIRE SAYS
4a8c040o HOLDERS OF ABOUT TWO OR THREE DOZEN OF THE INITIAL RUN OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TEN DOLLAR NOTES COMPLAINED TO THE RESERVE BANK THAT THE COOK PORTRAIT VANISHED
4a8c040p BUT EXAMINATION OF THE ALLEGEDLY FAULTY NOTES SHOWED EVIDENCE OF VIGOROUS RUBBING AND WILLFUL DAMAGE A RESERVE BANK *SPOKESMAN* SAYS
4a8c040q ONE COMPLAINER TURNED IN A NOTE THAT HE SAID HAD SHRIVELED WHEN LEFT IN THE SUN ON A CAR DASHBOARD
4a8c040r <NOISE> THE BANK DID ITS OWN DASHBOARD TEST AND PROVED IT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
4a8c040s THEY SUSPECT THE MAN LAID THE NOTE ON A HOT RADIATOR
4a8c040t MOST FUNERALS ARE TERRIBLY DIGNIFIED AFFAIRS
4a8c040u DIGNIFIED MUSIC DIGNIFIED WORDS AND FROM THE FLORIST DIGNIFIED FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS
4a8c040v ALMOST AN EXCESS OF DIGNITY YOU MIGHT SAY
4a8c040w THE NORMALLY PLODDING SEARS IS NOW COPYING WARD'S SPECIALTY STORE SCHEME
4a8c040x <NOISE> ON WEDNESDAY IT AGREED TO BUY WESTERN AUTO SUPPLY COMPANY ITS THIRD SUCH VENTURE INTO SPECIALTY RETAILING IN RECENT MONTHS
4a8c040y LATER THIS YEAR SEARS PLANS TO OPEN SELF CONTAINED APPLIANCE AND HOME SHOPS TO COMPETE WITH WARD
4a8c040z SEARS IS ALSO FOLLOWING WARD'S FORAY INTO SELLING MORE BRANDED MERCHANDISE ESPECIALLY IN APPLIANCES
4a8c0410 AND IT IS BRANCHING OUT OF MALLS TO OPEN SMALLER NEIGHBORHOOD STORES THAT COULD WHITTLE AWAY WARD'S CUSTOMER BASE
4a9c0201 SO WHILE THE SUBSIDIES ARE A GREAT HELP MOST FARMERS COULD PROBABLY MANAGE WITHOUT THEM
4a9c0202 YET BECAUSE FARMERS HAVE SO MUCH INFLUENCE POLITICIANS CONTINUE TO SUPPORT WHAT IS IN EFFECT A WELFARE SYSTEM FOR FARMERS
4a9c0203 BY KEEPING FOOD COSTS HIGH THE SYSTEM HURTS THE MORE NUMEROUS BUT LESS POWERFUL CITY DWELLERS
4a9c020a THE RIGHT WING UNDERWORLD ISN'T ALWAYS ON THE SIDE OF THE LANDOWNER AS THE ATTACKS ON THE SUMITOMO COMPANIES SUGGEST
4a9c020b A YEAR AGO SUMITOMO REALTY RECEIVED A BOMB THREAT AT ITS TOKYO HEADQUARTERS AND MR. ANDO THE CHAIRMAN FOUND A CARDBOARD BOX BURNING ON HIS DOORSTEP
4a9c020c THIS OCCURRED WHEN ALLEGATIONS SURFACED LINKING FORMER SUMITOMO EXECUTIVES WITH A LOAN SCANDAL INVOLVING A LAND SHARK COMPANY
4a9c020m <NOISE> THE TEAM SAYS THIS KIND OF ACTION PROTECTS ITS VALUABLE PLAYERS FROM ABUSE

4a9c020p I TOLD JOEY TO GO OUT THERE AND TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT AGAIN SAYS THE COACH
4a9c020q THE MESSAGE GOT THROUGH IF NOT NECESSARILY IN WORDS
4a9c021b MR. GIULIANI DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS FROM THIS NEWSPAPER YESTERDAY
4a9c021c MR. ROMANO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ARREST OF THE MEN IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS HASTY
4a9c021d PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION SAY TALKS BETWEEN GOLDMAN SACHS AND THE S. E. C. HAVEN'T BEGUN YET NOR HAVE TALKS BETWEEN MR. FREEMAN AND THE S. E. C.
4a9c021e AND AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FIRM LAWRENCE PEDOWITZ MAINTAINS THAT GOLDMAN ITSELF WAS BLAMELESS IN MR. FREEMAN'S WRONGDOING
4a9c021f THE FIRM HAD STATE OF THE ART COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT MR. PEDOWITZ SAYS
4a9c021g I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WERE IN ANY RESPECT INADEQUATE
4a9c021h THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME THINGS NO COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT CAN PICK UP
4a9c0301 AND THE COMMISSION IS ATTEMPTING TO ENSURE THAT THE WEAKER DOLLAR DOESN'T KEEP AMERICANS AWAY
4a9c0302 WE'RE TRYING TO URGE THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO STABILIZE PRICES SO THAT THEY DON'T FLUCTUATE AS MUCH AS THE DOLLAR SAYS SPOKESMAN NEIL MARTIN
4a9c0303 EVEN SO SOME PRICES THOSE FOR MANY LUXURY HOTELS IN ITALY AND FRANCE FOR EXAMPLE HAVE BEEN SOARING
4a9c030d COSTS ARE ANOTHER PROBLEM
4a9c030e DOCTOR RESNICK SAYS ULTRASOUND SCREENINGS FOR PROSTATE CANCER CAN COST UP TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS COMPARED TO TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A TRADITIONAL PROSTATE EXAM
4a9c030f ALSO HE SAYS THE ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE TAKES FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MINUTES COMPARED WITH FIVE MINUTES FOR THE TRADITIONAL METHOD
4a9c030g ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL NEW TAXES ARE UNLIKELY THIS YEAR THE CURRENT DEBATE IS IMPORTANT
4a9c030h DEMOCRATS LIKE HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER JAMES WRIGHT AND MAJORITY WHIP TONY COELHO BELIEVE THEY CAN CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT PRESIDENT REAGAN HAS BEEN TOO KIND TO THE RICH
4a9c030i HOW THAT POLITICAL STATEMENT IS RECEIVED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HOW IT PLAYS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ELECTIONS COULD DETERMINE THE NATURE OF FUTURE TAX INCREASES
4a9c030r HOW WILL THE COMPANY DEAL WITH ITS DEBT AND OPERATIONS AFTER THE CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP
4a9c030t STEGEMEIER IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT AFTER HE BECOMES CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE COMPANY SPOKESMAN SAID
4a9c0404 SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO BRITISH INVESTORS' REGARD FOR THESE SERVICE COMPANIES
4a9c0405 U. S. AND BRITISH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS DIFFER FOR THE GOOD WILL ARISING FROM ACQUISITIONS YIELDING HIGHER REPORTED EARNINGS FOR BRITISH COMPANIES
4a9c0406 SOME ANALYSTS SUGGEST U. K. INVESTORS HAVE FEW HIGH GROWTH INDUSTRIES TO CHOOSE FROM AND SO LOOK FAVORABLY ON SERVICE COMPANIES
4a9c040a ASSETS OF TWO HUNDRED GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDS ROSE ONE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO SEVENTY POINT THREE SIX BILLION DOLLARS
4a9c040b ASSETS OF NINETY THREE BROKER DEALER FUNDS FELL THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED EIGHT POINT ZERO ONE BILLION DOLLARS

4a9c040e ACCORDING TO RECENT INDUSTRY STATISTICS THE POST'S DAILY CIRCULATION IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND THE CHRONICLE'S APPROXIMATES FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
4a9c040f THE POST CLAIMS TO HAVE ROUGHLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE HOUSTON ADVERTISING MARKET
4a9c040k MANY ECONOMISTS FEAR THE STOCK MARKET'S COLLAPSE ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH WILL MAKE SHOPPERS MORE CAUTIOUS ESPECIALLY ON SUCH MAJOR PURCHASES AS AUTOS AND HOMES
4a9c040w EQUICOR WAS LAUNCHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BY EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION TO PROVIDE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND TO MANAGE HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS FOR CORPORATIONS
4a9c040x AFTER POSTING TWO YEARS OF LOSSES IT BROKE EVEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR
4a9c040y EXECUTIVES OF BOTH EQUITABLE AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION SAID THEY EXPECT THE VENTURE TO BE PROFITABLE THIS YEAR
4aac0201 MR. DAVIDOFF COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
4aac0202 HIS LAWYER PAUL ROONEY SAID MR.
4aac0203 DAVIDOFF DEEPLY REGRETS HIS INVOLVEMENT IN THE BOESKY COMPANY'S FAILURE TO REMAIN AT ALL TIMES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S NET CAPITAL RULES
4aac0204 MR. ROONEY EMPHASIZED THAT MR. DAVIDOFF WASN'T CHARGED WITH INSIDER TRADING
4aac0205 WILLFUL VIOLATION OF THE CAPITAL RULE CARRIES A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF FIVE YEARS IN PRISON AND A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE
4aac020d PUROLATOR JUMPED FIVE AND A HALF TO FORTY AND THREE EIGHTHS
4aac020e EMERY AIR FREIGHT BEGAN A FORTY DOLLAR A SHARE TENDER OFFER FOR EIGHTY THREE PERCENT OF PUROLATOR'S COMMON
4aac020f EMERY ROSE SEVEN EIGHTHS TO THIRTEEN AND ONE HALF
4aac020j MITSUBISHI HAS AN INFLUENTIAL NAME WHICH IS ONE REASON FOR THE REPUTATION DEALERS SAID
4aac020k BUT IT ALSO BENEFITED FROM HAVING LAUNCHED THE BONDS JUST AHEAD OF A NUMBER OF SCHEDULED DEALS BY OTHER JAPANESE BANKS GETTING INTO THE MARKET BEFORE OVERCROWDING TAKES PLACE
4aac020l BECAUSE THE BANK CONVERTIBLES GENERALLY APPEAL TO A MORE CONSERVATIVE MARKET SEGMENT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN AFFECTED BY THE PROBLEMS OF THE EQUITY WARRANT SECTOR
4aac020p MR. PATRICK AND ANYONE ELSE GIVING THE MATTER SERIOUS THOUGHT KNOWS THAT REGULATORY BODIES CAN'T MANAGE ENTERPRISES HARD AS THEY TRY
4aac020q EVEN THE APPOINTED MANAGERS OF UNREGULATED COMPANIES IN COMPETITIVE INDUSTRIES HAVE A HARD TIME CONTROLLING COSTS
4aac020r AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO DO THE OPPOSITE
4aac020t ONE YIELDED REPRIMANDS OF REPS.
4aac020u DANIEL CRANE REPUBLICAN ILLINOIS AND GERRY STUDDS DEMOCRAT MASSACHUSETTS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE FOR SEXUAL AFFAIRS WITH HOUSE PAGES
4aac020v REP. GEORGE HANSEN REPUBLICAN IDAHO DREW A REPRIMAND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AFTER A FELONY CONVICTION FOR FALSIFYING HIS FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES
4aac0215 THE ARMY WANTS TO STOP BUYING THE TRUCKS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO HAUL UP TO TEN TONS OF AMMUNITION MORTARS AND ROCKETS TO SOME PROSPECTIVE BATTLEFIELD
4aac0216 IT WANTS TO CONCENTRATE INSTEAD ON DEVELOPING A NEW SIXTEEN TON TRUCK
4aac0217 BUT MR. ASPIN WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN
4aac0218 AT HIS BEHEST AND AGAINST THE PENTAGON'S WISHES CONGRESS CONTINUES TO POUR MONEY INTO THE TRUCK PROGRAM
4aac0219 BUT WHEN THE SUBJECT IS FARMING HE CAN'T MASK HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
4aac021a I THOUGHT I'D BE IN A HECK OF A LOT BETTER POSITION BY NOW HE SAYS
4aac021b BEFORE THE DROUGHT I THOUGHT WE HAD A GOOD SHOT AT A GOOD YEAR
4aac021c THE PLYWOOD AND INSULATION MAKER SAID IT DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF ONE SHARE OF A NEW ISSUE OF PREFERRED STOCK FOR EACH OF ITS COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING
4aac021d THE RIGHTS GIVE HOLDERS THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE COMPANY SHARES AT A STEEP DISCOUNT IN VARIOUS HOSTILE TAKEOVER CIRCUMSTANCES
4aac021e THE DISTRIBUTION IS PAYABLE TO HOLDERS OF RECORD SEPTEMBER NINE AND EXPIRES AUGUST THIRTY ONE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT
4aac030j THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD CAP A HIGHLY PUBLICIZED SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE NEW HOME
4aac030k IT ALSO WOULD REPRESENT A MAJOR VICTORY FOR NEW YORK CITY WHICH HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO KEEP COMPANIES FROM FLEEING THE CITY
4aac030l N. B. C. HAD BEEN CONSIDERING MOVING SOME OR ALL OF ITS FACILITIES TO NEW JERSEY
4aac030p MR. MCMILLIN SAID THE TWO RETAILING UNITS COULD FETCH BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
4aac030q BUT SPECULATION IN RETAILING CIRCLES PUT THE POTENTIAL PRICE TAG AT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
4aac030r IT'S THE WORST TIME TO SELL A RETAILER SAID ONE INDUSTRY EXECUTIVE
4aac030s THEY MISSED THE HIGH IN AUGUST WHEN PUBLICLY TRADED SPECIALTY RETAILERS WERE SELLING AT MULTIPLES AS HIGH AS THIRTY FIVE TIMES EARNINGS
4aac030t NOW THEY'RE TRADING AT TEN TO TWELVE TIMES EARNINGS
4aac030u AND ACCORDING TO TEXACO IT COULD ALL ADD UP TO SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS BY MR. ICAHN
4aac030v TO ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE IN SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH A SERIOUS PARTNER IF YOU'RE NOT IS A SERIOUS VIOLATION MR. *BOIES* SAID
4aac030w MR. ICAHN HOWEVER TICKED OFF NUMEROUS DETAILS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE THIRD PARTIES
4aac030x THESE DETAILS HE SAID WERE INDICATIONS THAT TALKS WERE SERIOUS AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED
4aac030y UNCONVINCED THE HARRISBURG CITY COUNCIL IN APRIL PASSED AN ORDINANCE REQUIRING LOCAL EMPLOYERS WITH TEN OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO GIVE UP TO TWELVE WEEKS OF UNPAID PARENTAL LEAVE
4aac030z HARRISBURG IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST U. S. CITY TO PASS SUCH A STATUTE AND IT IS MUCH STRICTER THAN ANY STATE LEGISLATION
4aac0310 FOR INSTANCE WISCONSIN PASSED A PARENTAL LEAVE LAW IN APRIL WHICH PROVIDES ONLY SIX WEEKS OF UNPAID LEAVE AND EXEMPTS COMPANIES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES
4aac0311 MERITOR ALSO JOINED THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM LAST MONTH
4aac0312 IT CAN BORROW INTERMEDIATE TERM FUNDS FROM THE BANK SYSTEM WHICH WOULD ALLOW MERITOR TO MORE CLOSELY MATCH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
4aac0313 ITS DEPOSITS ARE STILL INSURED BY FEDERAL *DEPOSIT* INSURANCE CORP.
4aac0401 MR. REGAN ASKED YESTERDAY WHETHER HE PLANS TO RESIGN TOLD REPORTERS NO ABSOLUTELY NOT
4aac0402 THE FORMER MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY CHAIRMAN ADDED FURTHER THAT IF I'M INEFFECTIVE OR NOT HELPING THIS PRESIDENT OBVIOUSLY I WOULD RESIGN
4aac0403 BUT IN THIS CASE I DON'T FEEL I HAVE ANY *PARTICULAR* CULPABILITY
4aac0404 FOUR OTHER COMPANIES ARE VYING TO SHARE THE BOOSTER ROCKET BUSINESS WITH MORTON HERCULES INC. AEROJET GENERAL CORP. UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP. AND ATLANTIC RESEARCH CORP.
4aac0405 A HERCULES REPRESENTATIVE CONTENDED AT THE HEARING THAT THE COMPETITION COULD LOWER THE COST OF THE BOOSTER ROCKET AS MUCH AS ONE THIRD
4aac0406 AN OFFICIAL OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES' CHEMICAL SYSTEMS DIVISION SAID THE COMPANY HAS STUDIED WAYS OF TERMINATING THE BOOSTER ROCKETS IN THE EVENT OF A MALFUNCTION
4aac040d THE WINNERS THE AMERICANS FOR THE SECOND YEAR IN A ROW WITH A TIME OF FIVE MINUTES FOUR SECONDS
4aac040e CANADA CLOCKED IN AT FIVE MINUTES THIRTY FIVE SECONDS
4aac040f IN THE GLORY OF THE MOMENT THE DETROIT POLICEMEN HUGGED ONE ANOTHER AND SHOUTED WE'RE NUMBER ONE
4aac040g DURABLE GOODS ORDERS ROSE ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT IN JUNE BUT THE GAIN CAME ENTIRELY FROM MILITARY ITEMS
4aac040h THE REPORT WAS CONSIDERED A FURTHER SIGN THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK
4aac040i BUT ANALYSTS SAY MANUFACTURING IS IMPROVING
4aac0413 SOURCES SAID THAT SENATE G. O. P. LEADER DOLE HAD BEEN NOTIFIED BY BUSH THAT HE WAS AMONG ABOUT A DOZEN VICE PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS
4aac0415 U. S. SHOE CORP. SAID IT ACQUIRED TWENTY NINE SHOE STORES FROM ARIZONA SHOE CORP.

4abc0205 FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE GOLDMAN SACHS PRIDES ITSELF ON ITS REPUTATION AS ONE OF WALL STREET'S MOST ELITE FIRMS
4abc0206 GOLDMAN PARTNERS ROUTINELY HAVE EMPHASIZED THEIR TEAMWORK APPROACH TO INVESTMENT BANKING AND INSISTED THAT THEY HAD HIGHER ETHICAL STANDARDS THAN COMPETITORS'
4abc0207 FOR EXAMPLE GOLDMAN PROUDLY PROCLAIMED THAT ITS INVESTMENT BANKERS WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TAKE PHONE CALLS FROM ARBITRAGERS AND THAT THE FIRM RARELY ADVISED FIRMS PLANNING HOSTILE TAKEOVERS
4abc020b THE ONLY THING IN HER NEW LIFE THAT MAKES MRS. BOTTEL FROWN IS THAT SHE NO LONGER GETS TO CHOOSE THE LETTERS SHE ANSWERS
4abc020c EACH MONTH THE YOMIURI SENDS HER A BATCH CAREFULLY TRANSLATED AND TYPED IN ENGLISH
4abc020d IN A CHEERY ROOM OF HER SUBURBAN RANCH STYLE HOUSE MRS. BOTTEL WRITES HER REPLIES THEN SENDS THEM TO TOKYO WHERE THEY ARE TRANSLATED INTO JAPANESE
4abc020e STILL EVEN A MAJOR SLOWDOWN COULD PERMIT HEFTY FUND GROWTH CONSIDERING LAST YEAR'S RECORD GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS
4abc020f NET NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES AFTER REDEMPTIONS WERE ONE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS
4abc020g A SPOT SURVEY HERE SHOWED THAT MANY EXECUTIVES THINK BOTH GROSS AND NET SALES FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR MAY RANGE FROM FLAT TO DOWN THIRTY PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR
4abc020t LAWRENCE KUDLOW OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY HAS ENTERED A RECESSION
4abc020u BUT HE EQUALLY DISAGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION PRESSURES WILL SURGE
4abc020v ALL THIS TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OVERHEATING AND HIGHER INFLATION IS COMPLETELY MISPLACED HE SAID
4abc020w IT'S A SNARE AND A DELUSION
4abc0216 WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEMOANS THE DETERIORATING QUALITY OF U. S. EDUCATION STATES SUCH AS SOUTH CAROLINA HAVE BEEN ACTING TO TURN THE SITUATION AROUND
4abc0217 NEW JERSEY FOR INSTANCE HAS LAUNCHED ALTERNATIVE CERTIFICATION FOR TEACHERS OPENING UP THE FIELD TO MANY TALENTED PEOPLE WITH NO FORMAL EDUCATION TRAINING
4abc0218 MINNESOTA ALLOWS STUDENTS TO ATTEND ANY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE STATE THAT WILL HAVE THEM TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM SCHOOLS THAT LOSE KIDS
4abc0219 MASSACHUSETTS IS PILOTING A SCHOOL BASED MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT TAKES POWER AWAY FROM CENTRAL DISTRICT OFFICES AND GIVES TEACHERS MORE AUTHORITY IN STAFFING AND INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS
4abc0301 THE U. S. WOULDN'T BE SORRY TO SEE THE SOVIET PEACE OFFENSIVE FALTER
4abc0302 SOME THINK THE RUSSIANS HOPE THEIR EFFORT WILL FOMENT DISCORD IN PAKISTAN WHERE OPPOSITION PARTIES MAY USE IT TO OPPOSE GOVERNMENT POLICY OF HARBORING AFGHAN GUERRILLAS
4abc0303 MEANWHILE THE WAR CONTINUES TO DAMAGE THE SOVIETS' THIRD WORLD RELATIONS WHILE DRAINING THEIR ECONOMY AND MILITARY
4abc030a TRADERS SAID THEY WERE PUZZLED BY THE MARKET'S FALL IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC NEWS
4abc030b VOLUME WAS HEAVY WITH EXPORT LED SHARES ACCOUNTING FOR MUCH OF THE DECLINE
4abc030c STEEL MACHINERY TOOL AND CHEMICAL SHARES CLOSED HIGHER
4abc030d TAX TALK BY JAMES BAKER AND HOWARD BAKER RILES ADMINISTRATION CONSERVATIVES
4abc030e IF THE PRESIDENT SIGNS OFF ON SIGNIFICANT TAXES THERE'LL BE A LOT OF SCREAMING AND SHOUTING SAYS A WHITE HOUSE AIDE
4abc030f BUT DESPITE THE RHETORIC ANY TAX BILL ACCEPTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO DO LITTLE TO REDUCE THE RED INK
4abc030g SEVERE NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY THE HOUSE ON TAKEOVERS ALSO APPEAR DOOMED
4abc030h THE REPORT SIGNALED THE OPENING SALVO IN WHAT APPEARS WILL BE A CONTENTIOUS MEETING DURING WHICH THE THIRTEEN MEMBER CARTEL WILL GRAPPLE WITH PRICE AND PRODUCTION ISSUES
4abc030i FOUR OPEC MEMBERS IRAN LIBYA ALGERIA AND NIGERIA HAVE CALLED FOR AT LEAST A TWO DOLLAR PRICE INCREASE WHILE OPPOSING ANY HIGHER OUTPUT
4abc030j THE MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE IS TO BEGIN DECEMBER NINTH IN VIENNA
4abc030t BUT MR. CONABLE'S OWN NATURE STILL ISN'T CLEAR REPRESENTATIVE LAFALCE ARGUES
4abc030u BARBER CONABLE IS AN OUTSTANDING PERSON HE SAYS
4abc030v HE HAD A STRONG IDENTITY HERE IN CONGRESS WHICH HE EARNED
4abc030w BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN IDENTITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK
4abc030x HE WAS CREATED BY JIM BAKER AND GEORGE BUSH IN THIS JOB
4abc030y HIS REPUTATION NOW RESTS ON HOW HE DEFINES HIMSELF
4abc0401 NOT MR. WALTER
4abc0402 HE SPREADS THE GOSPEL OF COMPUTER LITERACY AND TRIES TO TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY OUT OF COMPUTERS AND PUT SOME OF THE FUN BACK IN
4abc0403 MR. WALTER BRINGS RELIGIOUS LIKE FERVOR TO THE DIGITAL WORLD
4abc0404 YOU HAVE NUNS AND PRIESTS WHO DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY
4abc0405 I'M UNIQUE ONLY IN RELATION TO THE COMPUTER FIELD HE SAYS
4abc040a IN FRANKFURT PRICES CLOSED MIXED TO HIGHER IN LIVELY TRADING
4abc040b STOCKS OPENED MUCH FIRMER BUT WERE BROUGHT LOWER BY A WAVE OF PROFIT TAKING
4abc040c ELECTRONICS COMPANIES SIEMENS NIXDORF AND A. E. G. ALL CLOSED HIGHER
4abc040d AUTO MAKERS WERE MIXED WITH DAIMLER BENZ CLOSING SLIGHTLY DOWN BUT VOLKSWAGEN B. M. W. AND PORSCHE RISING
4abc040g THE GLASS STEAGALL ACT SEPARATING COMMERCIAL FROM INVESTMENT BANKING IN THE U. S. GRADUALLY WILL CHANGE OR BE DONE AWAY WITH SAYS MR. KOMATSU
4abc040s THE BONDS ARE NONCALLABLE
4abc040t BONDHOLDERS HAVE THE OPTION ON FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH NINETEEN NINETY THREE TO PUT THE BONDS BACK TO THE COMPANY AT PAR
4abc040u THE ISSUE WAS PRICED ONE HUNDRED BASIS POINTS ABOVE THE RATE OF THE TREASURY'S FIVE YEAR NOTE
4abc040v SUBSEQUENT GOVERNMENT REPORTS HOWEVER SHOW THAT EMPLOYMENT GROWTH WAS RELATIVELY STRONG IN THE FIRST QUARTER
4abc040w MOREOVER THE FOURTH QUARTER BUILD UP IN BUSINESS INVENTORIES HAS BEEN REVISED DOWN SOMEWHAT BY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT
4abc040x AS A RESULT THE CENTRAL BANK APPARENTLY IS REVERSING ITS JANUARY MOVE
4abc040y THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO START SHIPPING THE MACHINE THIS MONTH
4abc040z BUT DON'T TOSS ALL YOUR PADS OF PAPER INTO THE GARBAGE YET
4abc0410 THE MACHINE HAS SOME LIMITATIONS
4abc0411 YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE STYLUS BETWEEN CHARACTERS
4abc0412 THE MACHINE ALSO CONVERTS HANDWRITING AT THE SLUGGISH PACE OF TWO SYMBOLS PER SECOND
4abc0413 AND AT TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED TO THIRTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WILL COST MORE THAN MOST CONVENTIONAL PORTABLE P. C.S
4abc0417 MR. BUSH'S SOLUTION TO RAMPANT CRIME IS APPARENTLY TO LOCK UP MORE AMERICANS AND KEEP THEM THERE
4abc0418 THE U. S. ALREADY VIES WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND SOUTH AFRICA FOR THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION IN THE WORLD
4abc0419 DURING THE PAST DECADE THE RATE HAS DOUBLED
4abc041a ON AN AVERAGE DAY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS ARE IN PRISON OR JAIL
4abc041b THAT IS ABOUT THREE OUT OF EVERY THOUSAND AMERICANS IN THE CASE OF BLACK MALES TWO OUT OF EVERY HUNDRED
4abc041c IF THE TREND WERE TO CONTINUE CALIFORNIA ALONE WOULD SOON INCARCERATE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE
4acc0209 THE COURT HAS ORDERED MR. WARD AND GUINNESS'S FORMER CHAIRMAN ERNEST SAUNDERS TO RETURN THE MONEY
4acc020a IT ALSO HAS FROZEN AS MUCH AS EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION OF THEIR ASSETS
4acc020b <NOISE> BUT THE TWO MEN'S LAWYERS ARE ASKING THAT THE ORDER GRANTED TEMPORARILY BE LIFTED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF A FULL TRIAL
4acc020f <NOISE> DOCTOR BRUNDTLAND THINKS THE NORWEGIAN REVOLUTION IS APPARENT IN HER OWN FAMILY
4acc020g HER HUSBAND AN EDITOR AND OCCASIONAL NEWSPAPER COLUMNIST BASED AT THE NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE FOR NATIONAL AFFAIRS IS A CONSERVATIVE
4acc020h INDIRECTLY AT LEAST WHAT HE WRITES IS OFTEN CRITICAL OF HER POLICIES A SITUATION THAT VISITING JOURNALISTS INVARIABLY ASK HER ABOUT
4acc020i HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CHINA HAD DECIDED TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES WITH THE U. S. AND JAPAN
4acc020j BUT NO MIRACLE IS GOING TO APPEAR
4acc020k <NOISE> ISN'T THIS OBVIOUS
4acc020l A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
4acc020m THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
4acc020n THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
4acc020o <NOISE> MR. ADELMAN SAYS THAT CLEARLY SERVES MOSCOW
4acc020p ARMS CONTROL SERVES THE SOVIETS MORE THAN IT SERVES US BECAUSE IT MAKES US MORAL EQUIVALENTS HE SAYS
4acc020q JUST THROUGH A PRESS RELEASE THEY CAN GIVE THE IMPRESSION THEY FAVOR PEACE
4acc020r HE ALSO POINTS OUT THAT NUCLEAR ARMS TALKS ARE ALSO WHERE MOSCOW BARGAINS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH BECAUSE OF ITS CONVENTIONAL MILITARY SUPERIORITY
4acc020s THE DEPRESSION WASN'T JUST ONE LONG SLUMP AS THE POPULAR IMAGE HAS IT BUT A SERIES OF RECOVERIES ABORTED BY FURTHER RECESSIONS
4acc020t THESE SLUMPS WITHIN THE SLUMP IN NINETEEN THIRTY THREE AND NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT WERE BOTH PRECEDED BY LARGE INCOME TAX INCREASES
4acc020u <NOISE> THIS FOLLY HAS NOT PASSED UNNOTICED BY KEYNESIANS
4acc020v HERBERT STEIN EXCLAIMED IN HIS NINETEEN SIXTY NINE BOOK THE FISCAL REVOLUTION IN AMERICA
4acc0219 I KNOW BUT IT'S CLOSE
4acc021a ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THIS
4acc021b BEING A LIBERAL IS NOT LIKE BEING A DEMOCRAT
4acc021c BEING A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN IS LIKE HAVING THE RED PIECES OR THE BLACK PIECES IN A CHECKERS GAME
4acc021d <NOISE> IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORAL IMPLICATIONS
4acc021e BUT BEING A LIBERAL IS BA:D
4acc021f YOU CAN BE A GOOD DEMOCRAT IF YOU'RE NOT LIBERAL AND YOU CAN BE A BAD REPUBLICAN IF YOU ARE LIBERAL
4acc030j PACIFIC POWER AND LIGHT IS THE PRINCIPAL UNIT OF PORTLAND OREGON BASED PACIFICORP
4acc030k A SPOKESMAN FOR THE UTILITY UNIT SAID IN OUR MINDS THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF PREFERENCE WAS LAID TO REST BY THE COURT'S DECISION
4acc030l THE COMPANY SAID IT EXPECTS TO PREVAIL WHEN THE COMMISSION WEIGHS THE OTHER SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS
4acc030m THIS IS A VICTORY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS ASSERTED THE SPOKESMAN ADDING THAT THE DAM PROVIDES OUR LOWEST COST SOURCE OF POWER
4acc030n HIS LONG RELUCTANCE TO STIMULATE THE WEST GERMAN ECONOMY HAS EXASPERATED OTHER WESTERN LEADERS
4acc030o AT HOME HIS DETERMINATION TO PUSH THROUGH A TAX ON INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS HAS NETTLED BUSINESSMEN
4acc030p IN ADDITION HE HAS SUFFERED CRITICISM OF HIS HANDLING OF AN ELECTION SCANDAL IN HIS HOME PROVINCE OF SCHLESWIG HOLSTEIN
4acc030q CONSIDER UNITED AIRLINES ONE OF THE I. B. M. NINETY THREE SEVENTY'S FIRST CUSTOMERS
4acc030r IT BOUGHT THE MACHINE FOR A NEW SYSTEM TO LINK ITS RESERVATIONS COMPUTER WITH TRAVEL AGENTS
4acc030s BUT THE SYSTEM UNITED UNVEILED THIS MONTH HAD I. B. M. PERSONAL COMPUTERS DOING SOME TASKS ORIGINALLY EARMARKED FOR THE NINETY THREE SEVENTY
4acc030t UNITED SAYS IT HAS BEEN BUYING NINETY THREE SEVENTIES MORE SLOWLY THAN IT ORIGINALLY PLANNED
4acc0407 REAGAN SAID IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON FROM INSIDE WASHINGTON POLITICS
4acc0408 THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS CAME A DAY AFTER HE CONCEDED THAT HIS IRAN POLICY WAS A MISTAKE
4acc0409 THE WHITE HOUSE MEANWHILE SOUGHT TO REGAIN POLITICAL MOMENTUM AND BEGAN WEIGHING SUCH IDEAS AS A BUDGET SUMMIT AND A REAGAN SPEAKING TOUR
4acc040o THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT TO PRESCRIBE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LAW WHEN A GOOD OR SERVICE IS INVOLVED
4acc040p LAWS AGAINST FRAUD SHOULD BE NO LESS APPLICABLE TO PLANT CLOSINGS OR MASS LAYOFFS
4acc040q IN SHORT GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEEK TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS LIVE UP TO THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AND SHOULD PROVIDE FOR LEGAL REMEDIES WHEN THEY DO NOT
4adc0204 AND YET THIS HAPLESS FELLOW HAD THE GUTS TO SUE HIS FATHER AND THE AMBITION TO GRAB FOR CONTROL OF THE CORPORATION THAT BEARS HIS NAME
4adc0205 HE IS MOST ELUSIVE
4adc0206 IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO HE TOURED NEW YORK'S TAKEOVER HOUSES BLITHELY CHATTING ABOUT GETTY'S PROBLEMS
4adc0207 WAS HE NAIVELY SEEKING ADVICE OR WAS HE SUBTLY SHOWING THAT HE WAS WILLING TO GO OUTSIDE THE FIRM FOR ALLIES TO OUST THE CURRENT MANAGEMENT
4adc0208 TWO DESIRABLE RESULTS ARISE FROM PLACING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DECISIONS AS CLOSE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AS POSSIBLE
4adc0209 FIRST THE DECISION MAKERS CLOSEST TO THE ISSUE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE BEST INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS
4adc020a SECOND THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES FOR EXPERIMENTATION WITH DIFFERENT RULES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
4adc020y CHECKOUT COUNTERS ARE PRIMARY IMPULSE BUYING SITUATIONS SAYS WILLARD BISHOP A FOOD RETAILING CONSULTANT
4adc020z AND THERE'S TREMENDOUS COMPETITION FOR ATTENTION NOT ONLY FROM OTHER MAGAZINES BUT FROM ITEMS LIKE CANDY TOBACCO AND RAZOR BLADES MR. BISHOP ADDS
4adc0210 THAT'S WHY MAGAZINE EXECUTIVES SAY COVERS HAVE TO REACH OUT AND GRAB BUYERS
4adc0214 I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER COCKBURN'S VIEWPOINT COLUMN
4adc0215 HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY
4adc0216 HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE
4adc021a THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING
4adc021b THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE ZERO YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING
4adc021c AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN
4adc0304 BANKS WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES EXCLUDED FROM THE PRIVATE TALKS
4adc0305 STEPHEN D. SUSMAN ONE OF THE HUNTS' LEAD ATTORNEYS SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DISCUSSIONS UNTIL HE STARTED HEARING THE OTHER BANKS' OBJECTIONS
4adc0306 BUT MR. SUSMAN SAID HE ISN'T TROUBLED BY THE MEETINGS
4adc0307 IT SEEMS LIKE GOOD SENSE TO ME
4adc0308 INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IN LITIGATION OUGHT TO BE TALKING TO PEOPLE TO TRY TO RESOLVE IT HE SAID
4adc030f WE HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEFER MEDIUM AND LONG TERM FINANCING SAYS MR. BLAKELY
4adc030g IN FACT WE JUST REVIEWED THIS SUBJECT AND DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL LATER THIS YEAR
4adc030h STILL HE ADDS I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR HIGHER RATES IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER
4adc030i AS FOR THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY IT IS SEEKING TO RETAIN THE REMAINING LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST BANK INTRUSIONS
4adc030j INVESTMENT BANKERS WARN OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND SELF DEALING IF COMMERCIAL BANKERS ARE ALLOWED TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH THEM
4adc030k DESPITE THE BANKERS' DIRE WARNINGS THEY ARGUE THE CIRCUMSTANCES DON'T CALL FOR CHANGING THE HALF CENTURY OLD SYSTEM
4adc030l THE SKY ISN'T FALLING SAYS ROBERT GERARD THE HEAD OF MORGAN STANLEY GROUP INCORPORATED'S MUNICIPAL FINANCE DIVISION
4adc030m SECURITIES UNDERWRITING ISN'T THE ANSWER FOR ENERGY AND AGRICULTURAL LOANS
4adc030v MERCEDES BENZ OF NORTH AMERICA INITIATED STANDARD DRIVER SIDE AIR BAGS ON ALL ITS U. S. MODELS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4adc030w LAST YEAR FOUR OTHER FOREIGN AUTO MAKERS MADE THE EQUIPMENT STANDARD ON SOME OF THEIR MODELS
4adc030x THOSE COMPANIES INCLUDE THE ACURA DIVISION OF HONDA MOTOR COMPANY B. M. W. OF NORTH AMERICA INCORPORATED VOLVO OF AMERICA CORPORATION AND PORSCHE CARS OF NORTH AMERICA
4adc0311 MARKEL CORPORATION OFFERING O- OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND COMMON SHARES
4adc0312 OF THE TOTAL SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES WILL BE SOLD BY THE COMPANY AND THE BALANCE VIA SMITH BARNEY HARRIS UPHAM AND COMPANY AND ALEX
4adc0313 BROWN AND SONS INCORPORATED
4adc0314 IN THE EVENT THIS DANGER WAS AVERTED
4adc0315 AFTER RECOVERING PART OF ITS LOSS IN THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER OCTOBER NINETEENTH THE MARKET SPUTTERED OUT OF THE YEAR WITH A PERSISTING SENSE OF CRISIS
4adc0316 IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY THE WORLD CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED MASSIVELY TO SUPPORT THE DOLLAR AND BACKED UP THE INTERVENTIONS WITH ADJUSTMENTS IN BASIC MONETARY POLICY
4adc0317 THE TREASURY BUNDESBANK RIFT WAS OBVIOUSLY RESOLVED AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION RESTORED
4adc0318 THE SENSE OF CRISIS DISSIPATED AND THE MARKET STARTED THE GRADUAL CLIMB TO ITS CURRENT LEVELS
4adc0401 THIS VARIABILITY IN FIT HAS ALSO BEEN EVIDENT IN THE MERGERS OF OTHER SOUTHEASTERN BANKING COMPANIES
4adc0402 EACH BANKING COMPANY YOU MENTIONED HAS MOVED TO PLACE ITS EXECUTIVES IN KEY POLICY JOBS IN ORDER TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF CULTURE POLICY AND PROCEDURES TO ACQUIRED BANKS
4adc0403 IN EACH CASE THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURES OF OFFICIALS OF THE MERGED BANKS EXTENDING TO FORMER C. E. O.S IN SOME INSTANCES
4adc0404 BORDER SKIRMISHES ARE PERIODIC
4adc0405 THE TWO COUNTRIES ARE ENGAGED IN A CONVENTIONAL ARMS RACE THAT HAS DRAGGED IN THE U. S. AND SOVIET UNION
4adc0406 INDIA AND PAKISTAN ALSO FEAR THE OTHER'S NUCLEAR POLICIES
4adc0407 THE U. S. CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING A FOUR POINT ZERO TWO BILLION DOLLAR DEFENSE AND ECONOMIC AID PACKAGE FOR PAKISTAN
4adc0408 THE SOVIET UNION HAS ASSURED NEW DELHI THAT ANY CONVENTIONAL WEAPON IN ITS ARSENAL IS AVAILABLE TO INDIA
4adc040c SO HOME EQUITY LOANS SEEM ALMOST SURE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN CONSUMER BORROWING FOR SOME YEARS TO COME
4adc040d THE PACE OF LENDING MAY SLOW AS CONSUMERS COMPLETE THE PROCESS OF SUBSTITUTING ONE FORM OF BORROWING FOR ANOTHER
4adc040e AND WHO KNOWS CONSUMERS MAY FINALLY GET A LITTLE MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THEIR BORROWING
4adc040f THE DIRECTORS DIDN'T INDICATE WHAT THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL BE ON THE SPLIT SHARES
4adc040g THE COMPANY HAS BEEN PAYING FORTY CENTS QUARTERLY ON PRE SPLIT SHARES
4adc040h THE LAST SUCH DIVIDEND WHICH WAS DECLARED JULY SECOND WILL BE PAID SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIRST TO SHARES OF RECORD AUGUST THIRTY FIRST
4adc040n HE IS STEPPING DOWN AFTER HAVING PASSED THE MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE OF SIXTY FIVE
4adc040v THE SHOCKER WAS THAT THE JUDGE HAD ORDERED A HUGE DAMAGE PAYMENT BEFORE CARBIDE'S LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES IF ANY HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AT A TRIAL
4adc040w AT FIRST GLANCE AT LEAST THE DECISION SEEMS TO VIOLATE ANY DEFENDANT'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRESENT EVIDENCE AND TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AGAINST IT
4adc040x A CARBIDE SPOKESMAN HAS DECREED THE RULING AS A JUDGMENT AND DECREE WITHOUT TRIAL
4adc0414 THE LAST TIME A JAPANESE NONGOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION SOLD STRAIGHT DEBT IN THE U. S. WAS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ACCORDING TO SECURITIES DATA COMPANY
4adc0415 IN JULY NIPPON TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE CORPORATION WHICH IS GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED RAISED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF TEN YEAR NOTES
4adc0416 TO RAISE MEDIUM TERM DEBT JAPANESE COMPANIES HAVE MOSTLY USED THE LESS REGULATED EUROMARKETS
4adc0417 EVEN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES NESTLE FORESEES HUGE POTENTIAL FOR EXTENDING ITS BRAND NAMES AND HIGHLY PROCESSED PRODUCTS
4adc0418 THE COMPANY IS OPENING SEVEN FACTORIES IN ASIA THIS YEAR AND NEXT
4adc0419 IT THINKS ASIAN SALES NOW THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE COMPANY TOTAL COULD REACH TWENTY PERCENT IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES
4adc041a TRITON LOOKS LIKE A LOVELY BOSTON SNOW A FEW DAYS AFTER A SNOWSTORM MARVELS MR. JOHNSON THE BUSY HEAD OF THE IMAGING TEAM'S TRITON GROUP
4adc041b YOU SEE PILES OF WHITE SNOW AND PATCHES WHERE THE DIRT SHOWS THROUGH
4adc041c MAYBE TRITON IS MORE LIKE A HUGE COMET THAN A MODEL FOR EARLY EARTH HE SPECULATES

4aec0316 IN FACT THE COVER OF AMERICAN BRANDS' OFFER DOCUMENT SAID IT DIDN'T INTEND TO ASSUME OR GUARANTEE THEM
4aec0317 THROUGH VAGUENESS MR. DUKAKIS AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DISGUISED THE TRUE COSTS OF THEIR BUDGET BUSTING PROPOSALS
4aec0318 VOTERS SHOULD CHALLENGE THEM TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY WILL PAY FOR THEIR COSTLY PROMISES
4aec0319 WILL THEY RAISE TAXES CUT OTHER PROGRAMS OR JUST LET THE DEFICIT AND DEBT SOAR EVEN HIGHER
4aec0406 MACHO NONSENSE OF THIS TYPE ABOUT WORLD TRADE IN THE NATION'S HIGHEST DELIBERATIVE BODY HELPS EXPLAIN WHY CONFIDENCE IN THE U. S. DOLLAR HAS NOT BEEN ROCK SOLID OF LATE

4afc030n MR. SCHWIND WHO SAID HIS FIRM HOLDS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CITICORP SHARES ASKED IS THIS THE FIRST AND LAST STAGE
4afc030o IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IF CITICORP DID ANOTHER ONE BILLION IN TWO YEARS' TIME
4afc040a <NOISE> SOME EXPERTS SAY THAT BECAUSE OF SWEEPING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY COULDN'T BE RE REGULATED EVEN IF PEOPLE WANTED
4afc040b BUT THE CONTINUING DECONTROL IN THIS AREA ALSO SHOWS THAT THE REGULATORY RESURGENCE IS SELECTIVE
4afc040c WHILE RULES ARE REVIVED TO DEAL WITH PUBLICIZED CONCERNS SUCH AS AIR AND RAIL SAFETY THE *GOVERNMENT* PULLBACK CONTINUES IN SUCH AREAS AS CONSUMER PROTECTION AND ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT
4afc040g <NOISE> THE *IRAN* CONTRA COMMITTEE ENDED ITS HEARINGS YESTERDAY IN A TORRENT OF MEMBERS' SPEECHES ABOUT LIES AND DECEIT
4afc040h <NOISE> CONGRESS NOW TURNS TO ITS REWRITE OF THE GRAMM RUDMAN LAW WHICH HAS TARGETED THE FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DEFICIT OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHT BILLION

4afc040s HE ALSO HAS LURED THREE FORMER EXECUTIVES WHO WORKED WITH HIM AT I. T. T.'S UNIT
4afc0410 INSTITUTIONALIZED AUDITING WOULD ALSO HELP REDUCE TAX EVASION
4afc0411 IF ACCOUNTING BECOMES INSTITUTIONALIZED IT WOULD ENABLE THE STATE TO COLLECT TAXES MORE EFFICIENTLY SAYS HAKAN ONCE A MANAGER OF ARTHUR YOUNG'S OFFICE IN ISTANBUL
4afc0412 <NOISE> NEARLY HALF OF ALL TAXABLE REVENUE GOES UNTAXED ACCORDING TO TURKEY'S FEDERAL TAX AUTHORITY
4afc0413 BUT AMERICAN EXPRESS INSISTS IT HAS NO INTENTION OF DOING THAT
4afc0414 THE ANSWER IS NO

4afc0416 <NOISE> THE SAME MENTALITY AFFECTED THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURES OF THE STORES MR. GARCIA SAID
4afc0417 HE OWNS THIRTY SEVEN BURGER KINGS IN FLORIDA BUT HE REFUSES TO PUT UP THE BUILDING THAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED BY BURGER KING
4afc0418 IT LOOKS LIKE A MATCHBOX
4afc041b AND THEN IN A PERFECTLY SYNCHRONIZED MOVE LONG LIVE THE GREAT LEADER KIM IL SUNG
4agc0204 HOLIDAY WAS ALSO VULNERABLE BECAUSE IT HADN'T MUCH CHANGED AND CONSUMERS HAD
4agc0205 THEY WERE MORE SOPHISTICATED AND WIDELY TRAVELED
4agc0206 THEY DEMANDED MORE AND INSTEAD OF GETTING BETTER MANY HOLIDAY INNS HAD GONE DOWNHILL
4agc020x THE FED ALLOWED THE MONEY SUPPLY TO V- GROW VERY RAPIDLY THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4agc020y THEN IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE CENTRAL BANK TIGHTENED UP SHARPLY
4agc0210 YOU COULD SAY THAT IT WAS OFFSETTING THE EXCESSIVELY EASY POLICY OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
4agc0215 AMONG THE SEVENTY EIGHT BOND FUNDS TRACKED FOR THE ASSOCIATION WARDLEY GLOBAL SELECT STERLING BOND FUND TURNED IN THE QUARTER'S BEST RETURN OF ELEVEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
4agc0216 REFLECTING THE STRENGTH OF THE POUND BRITISH BOND FUNDS PERFORMED BEST AS A GROUP WITH A SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT MEDIAN RETURN
4agc0217 FUNDS HEAVILY INVESTED IN U. S. AND SWISS BONDS YIELDED THE QUARTER'S POOREST RETURNS
4agc030e IT IS A MISSION THAT REMAINS RELEVANT IN THE POST SEGREGATION ERA
4agc030f MANY CURRENT MOREHOUSE STUDENTS WERE OFFERED SCHOLARSHIPS BY PREDOMINANTLY WHITE SCHOOLS BUT CAME HERE INSTEAD
4agc030g FOR EXAMPLE ARCHIE RICH A DETROIT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL GRADUATE TURNED DOWN A DIVING SCHOLARSHIP FROM MICHIGAN'S OAKLAND UNIVERSITY IN FAVOR OF MOREHOUSE
4agc030h I'VE ALWAYS FELT A STRONG RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BLACK COMMUNITY HE SAYS
4agc030o THE COMPANY SAID THE CHARGE IS RELATED TO THE CLOSING AND WRITE OFF OF VARIOUS MARGINAL AND UNPROFITABLE OPERATIONS
4agc030p UNITED HEALTHCARE SAID IT WILL CLOSE AN UNPROFITABLE H. M. O. IN PHOENIX ARIZONA AND H. M. O. STARTUPS IN SIX CITIES
4agc030q IT WILL ALSO RESERVE THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS AGAINST INVESTMENTS AND LOANS TO H. M. O.S IN PITTSBURGH PHILADELPHIA AND THE CAROLINAS
4agc030u PRINCIPALS OF A. W. A NEWLY FORMED CORPORATION INCLUDE ARTHUR G. HAILAND FORMER CHAIRMAN OF AIR WIS WHO WAS REMOVED FROM THAT JOB AFTER THE PREVIOUS OFFER
4agc030v HE REMAINS A DIRECTOR
4agc030w AIR WIS IS THE HOLDING COMPANY FOR AIR WISCONSIN AN APPLETON WISCONSIN BASED COMMUTER AIRLINE
4agc0311 CONGRESS ALSO NEEDS TO TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS OWN ABILITY TO PROTECT SECRETS
4agc0312 CURRENT PROCEDURES ALMOST REQUIRE AN OPERATION'S COVER TO BE BLOWN BEFORE THE OPERATION CAN BE DISCUSSED OUTSIDE OF COMMITTEE
4agc0313 IF CONGRESS HAD ADEQUATE SECURITY LAWS AND PROCEDURES WITH STIFF PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THE END RESULT PROBABLY WOULD BE MORE FRANK DISCUSSION NOT LESS
4agc0317 THE SCHOOL HAS VACILLATED WITH ITS SMOKING POLICY
4agc0318 LAST YEAR IT ALLOWED SMOKING ALONE AND IN SILENCE
4agc0319 BUT AS STUDENTS KNOW CIGARETTES KILL
4agc031a SMOKING IS UN QUAKER LIKE AS WELL AS STUPID
4agc031b MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE
4agc031c HE ALSO SAID IT MIGHT ACCELERATE FURTHER OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS BEFORE LEVELING OFF
4agc031d BUT THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY SAID HE HOPED THAT PRICE INCREASES LIKE THE LABOR SHORTAGE WOULD EASE IF THE LOCAL ECONOMY SLOWS AS HE HAS PREDICTED
4agc0405 AMONG THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS DID MESSRS.
4agc0406 BOESKY OR STEINBERG RECEIVE INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECRET MERGER TALKS
4agc0407 DID THEIR LARGE POTENTIALLY UNFRIENDLY POSITIONS IN HARRIS ENCOURAGE HARRIS OFFICIALS TO COMPLETE A SALE
4agc0408 WERE THEY WORKING TOGETHER SEPARATELY OR IN CONCERT WITH DREXEL OFFICIALS TO BRING ABOUT A SALE OF HARRIS
4agc040c THE LAW EVEN COMES WITH ITS OWN CATCH TWENTY TWO
4agc040d YOU'LL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE TO FILL OUT YOUR OWN TAX RETURN ROGER TELLS ME
4agc040e BUT THE LAW ALSO SAYS YOU PROBABLY NO LONGER CAN DEDUCT THE COST OF HIRING PROFESSIONAL HELP
4agc040f IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL CHECKING ACCOUNTS AND A MONEY MARKET FUND HE STILL KEEPS AN OLD FASHIONED SAVINGS ACCOUNT
4agc040g THE REASON
4agc040h TO BE FAIR TO THE BANK MR. MERRITT SAYS
4agc040i IN EXCHANGE FOR GOOD BANKING SERVICE HE FEELS IT'S ONLY REASONABLE TO ALLOW THE BANK A DOLLOP OF LOW COST FUNDS
4agc040n CALTON INCORPORATED A FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP NEW JERSEY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER SAID SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A RECAPITALIZATION PLAN CREATING A NEW CLASS OF STOCK
4agc040o THE CLASS B. SHARES WHICH HAVE TEN TIMES THE VOTING POWER OF COMMON WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO CURRENT HOLDERS
4agc040p CLASS B. SHARES CAN BE CONVERTED INTO REGULAR COMMON BUT GENERALLY WON'T BE TRANSFERABLE
4agc040q SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD JULY THIRTY FIRST WILL GET ONE CLASS B. SHARE FOR EACH COMMON SHARE HELD
4agc040r COMPANIES OFTEN CREATE DUAL CLASSES OF STOCK TO CONCENTRATING THE VOTING RIGHTS IN FRIENDLY HANDS THEREBY DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM MAKING UNFRIENDLY TAKEOVER BIDS
4agc0415 THE REPORT DOESN'T PREDICT ANY IMMINENT CRASH
4agc0416 INDEED ITS DETAILED ANALYSIS CITES SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS
4agc0417 SOLID USER DEMAND GENERATED BY HONG KONG'S ROBUST ECONOMY AND RISING INCOMES IS ONE FACTOR
4agc0418 ANOTHER IS HEAVY INVESTMENT INFLOWS FROM JAPAN AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND CHINA AND TAIWAN
4agc041f NOBODY KNOWS I HAVE THIS DISEASE MR. PARR CONFIDED
4agc041g I'VE GOT FOURTEEN PEOPLE WORKING FOR ME AND IF THEY FIND OUT THEY'LL LEAVE ME
4agc041h I COULD NEVER TELL THEM
4ahc020h MERRILL LYNCH CANADA INCORPORATED WILL BE GLOBAL MANAGER FOR THE OFFERING AND WILL LEAD CANADIAN UNDERWRITERS
4ahc020i THE U. S. SYNDICATE WILL BE LED BY MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY
4ahc020j AN INTERNATIONAL UNIT OF MERRILL LYNCH WILL LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL SYNDICATE
4ahc020u THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED SEVEN POINT ONE POINTS LOWER AT FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR THE DAY'S BEST LEVEL
4ahc020v VOLUME TOTALED A MODEST FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION SHARES DOWN FROM FIVE OH NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION FRIDAY
4ahc020w THE ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX CLOSED THIRTEEN POINT TWO POINTS LOWER AT SEVENTEEN SIXTY POINT TWO
4ahc0214 THERE ARE TOO MANY CU- CASES WHERE CUSTOMS OFFICERS HAD GIVEN THEIR OPINION THE CLASSIFICATION OF GOODS OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEADS
4ahc0215 THIS IS THE FAULT OF THE SERVICE
4ahc0216 BUT IT IS ALSO THE FAULT OF BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON THIS SORT OF INFORMAL ADVICE
4ahc0301 IN JULY COMPACT VIDEO SOLD EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF JUNK BONDS THROUGH DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT MR. PERELMAN'S INVESTMENT BANKER
4ahc0302 IT BOUGHT BROOKS IN SEPTEMBER FOR NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A BIT LESS THAN BOOK VALUE AND TOOK ON ITS DEBT OF SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS
4ahc0303 THE PAYMENT CONSISTED MOSTLY OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES APPARENTLY BOUGHT WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE DREXEL FINANCING AND A PROMISSORY NOTE
4ahc0304 BROOKS ITSELF BORROWED MONEY TO FUND THE THIRTY MILLION CASH PORTION
4ahc0305 BUT WHILE EUREKA PROJECTS ARE MORE EASILY APPROVED THE VAGUENESS OF THEIR FUNDING IS ONE REASON MANY EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PROGRAM'S VALUE
4ahc0306 ANOTHER IS ITS LOOSE ORGANIZATION WITH NO CENTRAL SYSTEM YET ESTABLISHED FOR CHECKING ON THE PROGRESS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS
4ahc0307 MOST OF THE PROJECTS ADOPTED OVER THE PAST YEAR HAVEN'T GOTTEN OFF THE DRAWING BOARD
4ahc0317 THE GUIDE LOOKS DOWN AND PULLS AT HIS SOCKS
4ahc0318 LATER HE SAYS WHEN THE RUSSIANS LIBERATED SMOLENSK A NEW COMMISSION FOUND GERMAN BULLETS IN THE SKULLS OF THE OFFICERS
4ahc0319 AND THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY WHERE SHOT IN THE BACKS OF THE HEADS WAS A GERMAN METHOD
4ahc031a AND THEY FOUND GERMAN WEAPONS
4ahc031b THAT IS WHY THE RUSSIANS SAID IT WAS DONE BY THE NAZIS IN NINETEEN FORTY ONE
4ahc031c AND THAT IS EVERYTHING I KNOW
4ahc040c THE BIG SPENDER ROUTINE ASKED ABOUT MY LIQUID ASSETS I TOLD ONE CALLER OF THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR IN MY MONEY MARKET FUND
4ahc040l A RECENT VOTING STUDY BY THE COMPETITIVE ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE TRIES TO MEASURE WHAT CONGRESSMEN ACTUALLY DO TO LOWER COMPETITIVE BARRIERS AND END CORPORATE SUBSIDIES NOT WHAT THEY SAY
4ahc040m IN THE LAST SESSION OF CONGRESS THE AVERAGE HOUSE MEMBER VOTED WITH C. E. I. ONLY FORTY PERCENT OF THE TIME
4ahc040n MEMBERS OF THE COMPETITIVENESS CAUCUS FARED WORSE THAN THE HOUSE AS A WHOLE THEIR AVERAGE SCORE WAS ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT
4ahc040o G. O. P. REPRESENTATIVE TOM DELAY OF TEXAS CALLS THEM MEMBERS OF THE PROTECTIONIST CAUCUS
4ahc040p WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES
4ahc040q OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS ON IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER
4ahc040r THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF
4ahc040s THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH
4ahc040t WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN SOME KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT TO WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN
4ahc040u IN SHORT FALL OF IRAN TO THE AYATOLLAH WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE
4ahc040v JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW
4ahc040w TWO PORTALS INSTEAD OF ONE HEADED BY TWO FINE SCIENTISTS MAY MEAN SPEEDIER HANDLING OF NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS DOCTOR JENNINGS SAID
4ahc040x BUT IF THAT DOOR IS JUST PAINTED ON HE ADDED IT MAY NOT CHANGE A LOT
4ahc0417 BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONG OTHER THINGS
4ahc0418 MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY S- NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES
4ahc0419 BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP *BURNUP* AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST
4ahc041a BY NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE COMPANIES WERE EXCHANGING SUITS THAT HAVE LINGERED IN THE COURTS EVER SINCE
4aic020o THEY REJECTED THE EARLIER OFFER BECAUSE FIRST BOSTON CORP; WAS UNABLE TO RENDER A FAIRNESS OPINION
4aic020p <NOISE> COMPUTER DO MOST CHARTING THESE DAYS BUT DIEHARDS SAY DRAWING THEM BY HAND GIVES A BETTER FEEL FOR THE MARKET
4aic020q THE COMPUTER DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT ABERRATIONS LIKE THIS *SAYS* MR. ELIADES WHO CHARTS ELECTRONICALLY AS WELL AS MANUALLY
4aic020r YOU ADD ON FIVE SHEETS OF PAPER YOU KNOW HOW THE MARKET IS DOING
4aic020z MR. ZIA SAID THAT DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES THE RESISTANCE WOULD OVERTHROW THE KABUL REGIME
4aic0210 LOOK AT THE PALESTINIANS THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR THEIR RIGHTS FOR FORTY YEARS HE SAID
4aic0211 THEY HAVEN'T ACHIEVED WHAT SEVEN DIVIDED AFGHAN PARTIES HAVE ACHIEVED IN EIGHT YEARS
4aic0212 IF THE RESISTANT FEUD OVER POWER ONCE THE KABUL REGIME FALLS HE SAID I WOULDN'T CARE LESS
4aic0213 AT FIRST THE REBELS TRIED TO STRUGGLE ALONG WITH THEIR HOME GROWN MULES
4aic0214 BUT THESE ANIMALS WERE A SCRAWNY LOT BY AMERICAN STANDARDS AND WHEN THEY WEREN'T WORKED TO DEATH THEY WERE GUNNED DOWN BY THE SOVIETS
4aic0215 THE TURKS WERE NEARBY BUT THEY ALSO HAD INFERIOR MULES
4aic0216 THE CHINESE CHARGED OUTLANDISH RATES FULLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MULE
4aic0217 THE EGYPTIANS WERE QUICKLY DRAINED OF THEIR SUPPLY
4aic0218 THE U. S. WAS THE REBELS' LAST BEST HOPE
4aic0304 HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS
4aic0305 THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE
4aic0306 THE NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS
4aic0307 OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING
4aic030h WE'VE HAD A MAJOR RUN UP LAST WEEK PARTICULARLY FRIDAY NOTED MR. POLCE
4aic030i BUT HE ADDED THAT THE DOLLAR CAME UP TOO FAST THE MARKET'S BEEN CONSOLIDATING ITS GAINS
4aic030j MOREOVER MR. POLCE SAID THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE TILL THE JAPANESE TRADE NUMBERS COME OUT
4aic0314 BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT
4aic0315 IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT
4aic0316 I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE
4aic0317 I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY
4aic0318 IN MY MINISTRY WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE ALTERNATIVES OF INDEPENDENCE
4aic0319 THERE ARE ALREADY TWO GERMANYS AND TWO KOREAS
4aic031a BUT AFTER CLOSE STUDY WE CONCLUDED THAT INDEPENDENCE IS A DEAD END
4aic031b WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE US
4aic031c AND IN THAT CASE WHAT'S THE USE OF DECLARING INDEPENDENCE
4aic031d THEN IN JUNE CAME A CASE INVOLVING COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO ATTEMPTED TO THROW A TUPPERWARE PARTY AT THE STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
4aic031e THEY WERE FORBIDDEN BY UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS WHO CITED RULES PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES ON CAMPUS
4aic031f THE STUDENTS SUED THE SCHOOL BUT THE SUPREME COURT HELD IN FAVOR OF THE UNIVERSITY BAN
4aic040f THE SUPREME COURT TURNED ITS BACK ON THE BASIC WISDOM OF THE COMMERCE *CLAUSE* LAST APRIL IN THE CASE OF THE C. T. S. CORP. VERSUS
4aic040g DYNAMICS CORP.
4aic040h THIS WAS THE CASE THAT UPHELD INDIANA'S LAW *REGULATING* CORPORATE TAKEOVERS WHICH WENT MUCH FURTHER THAN FEDERAL LAWS TO PROTECT TARGETS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE BIDDERS
4aic040i THE RESULT IS A CRUSH OF ANTI TAKEOVER LAWS IN A DOZEN STATES SO FAR
4aic040j THE ADMINISTRATION OPPOSES THE BILL AND NO SIMILAR LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE SENATE
4aic040k THE SENATE GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE'S SUBCOMMITTEE ON CIVIL SERVICE WILL HOLD HEARINGS O- ON THE MEASURE LATE THIS YEAR OR EARLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT A SPOKESMAN SAID
4aic040l CONGRESSIONAL SOURCES SAID THE LEGISLATION IS EXPECTED TO FACE GREATER OPPOSITION IN THE SENATE THAN IN THE HOUSE
4aic040n THE COMPANY SAID NET PROCEEDS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE MAINLY USED TO FINANCE GOLD MINING ACQUISITIONS
4aic040p OCEAN SPRAY SAYS IT SIMPLY CAN'T SELL PURE CRANBERRY JUICE BECAUSE IT'S TOO TART TASTING
4aic040q SO WHY NOT EXPLAIN THAT FACT ON THE LABEL
4aic040r CONSUMERS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME OUR PRODUCT IS LESS NUTRITIOUS THAN PURE ORANGE OR APPLE JUICE A SPOKESMAN SAYS
4aic040s BUT THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY SO
4aic040z GENERALLY ACCEPTED AS THE FIRST FANTASY HOTEL IS A HYATT BUILT FOR SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION ON THE ISLAND OF MAUI IN NINETEEN EIGHTY
4aic0410 THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN ROOM RESORT INCLUDES A ONE ACRE POOL SURROUNDED BY ARTIFICIAL ROCKS
4aic0411 GUESTS SWIM THROUGH MAN MADE WATERFALLS ZIP DOWN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOOT TALL WATER SLIDE AND OBSERVE FLOCKS OF *SWANS* PENGUINS AND FLAMINGOS
4aic0413 THE PRICE OF A TYPICAL MARKET BASKET RANGES FROM A QUARTER TO A FEW DOLLARS IN EQUIVALENT U. S. CURRENCY
4ajc0201 COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE SEEKING THIS KIND OF BUSINESS BECAUSE SOME OF THEIR LINES LENDING TO BLUE CHIP CORPORATIONS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE DRIED UP
4ajc0202 <NOISE> BIG COMPANIES NOW ISSUE THEIR OWN PAPER
4ajc0203 THE OLD GLASS STEAGALL ARGUMENTS AIMED AT LIMITING RISK AND DANGERS THAT BIG BANKS WOULD END UP CONTROLLING INDUSTRY LOOK MORE AND MORE DATED
4ajc0204 INVESTMENT BANKS PROVIDE BILLIONS IN BRIDGE LOANS FOR CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS AND TAKEOVERS
4ajc0205 INVESTMENT BANKS SEEKING MORE CASH WILL BE ABLE TO TEAM UP WITH COMMERCIAL BANKS WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK ABROAD AS GOLDMAN SACHS DID TO FIND JAPAN'S SUMITOMO BANK
4ajc0209 IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND ACCORD THE U. S. AND ITS ALLIES ASSERTED THAT THE DOLLAR HAD DECLINED ENOUGH
4ajc020a THEY PLEDGED TO INTERVENE JOINTLY IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS TO KEEP EXCHANGE RATES AT ABOUT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS
4ajc020b THE DOLLAR REMAINED STABLE FOR ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE ACCORD WAS REACHED BUT THEN BEGAN TO SLUMP AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN
4ajc020c CENTRAL BANKS INTERVENED AND EVENTUALLY HELPED ARREST THE SLIDE
4ajc020d MR. TRUMP HAD CHARACTERIZED HIS PURCHASES OF U. A. L. STOCK AS AN INVESTMENT IN A COMPANY WITH *UNDERVALUED* ASSETS
4ajc020e HE HAS SPOKEN OUT FREQUENTLY AGAINST U. A. L. MANAGEMENT IN RECENT WEEKS
4ajc020f HE HAS CALLED U. A. L.'S PLAN TO CHANGE ITS NAME TO ALLEGIS CORP. A WASTE OF MONEY AND THAT ALLEGIS SOUNDS LIKE SOME NEW DISEASE
4ajc020o DETAILS OF THE NEW OFFER WEREN'T DISCLOSED
4ajc020p THE RAILWAYS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A WAGE FREEZE LOWER WAGES FOR STARTING EMPLOYEES AND OTHER CONCESSIONS REJECTED BY THE UNIONS
4ajc020q <NOISE> THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT EXPIRES DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST
4ajc020r THE UNIONS HAVE BEEN SEEKING A FIVE PERCENT WAGE RAISE IN EACH OF TWO YEARS MORE JOB SECURITY AND GUARANTEES AGAINST SUBCONTRACTING
4ajc020s AFTER LEAVING THE SENATE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE MR. PROXMIRE SAID HE PLANS TO REMAIN ACTIVE AND HOPES TO WRITE ANOTHER BOOK
4ajc020t I'M NOT RETIRING FROM WORK HE SAID
4ajc020u I'M GOING TO WORK HARD <NOISE>
4ajc0219 THE COMPANY SAID THE RESULTS INDICATE ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE SALES ARE BEGINNING TO PAY OFF
4ajc021a LAST YEAR THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS TRAINING TO IMPROVE SERVICE
4ajc021b IN FEBRUARY IT LAUNCHED RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS FEATURING COMEDIAN MARTIN MULL AND IN APRIL IT UNVEILED A NEW MENU
4ajc0301 SPECULATION HEATS UP ON VOLCKER'S FUTURE
4ajc0302 SOME BELIEVE HIS ODDS OF BEING REAPPOINTED THIS SUMMER ARE ENHANCED BY THE WEAKENED POSITION OF WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF REGAN WHO WANTS VOLCKER OUT
4ajc0303 YET MANY INSIDERS DOUBT THAT VOLCKER WHO IS RESISTING THE ADMINISTRATION ON REGULATORY MATTERS WILL BE KEPT BARRING A FINANCIAL CRISIS
4ajc0307 ARTHUR CROZIER COUNSEL FOR BAIRD DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE FILING
4ajc0308 BAIRD IS A BEDFORD MASSACHUSETTS BASED MAKER OF ANALYTICAL AND OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS
4ajc0309 MARK FOUR IS AN AMHERST NEW YORK BASED MAKER OF INDUSTRIAL DEFENSE AND AEROSPACE PRODUCTS

4ajc0311 HE HAS INDICATED THAT PRIORITIES WOULD INCLUDE BANK FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND TIGHTENING F. B. I. PROCEDURES FOR UNDERCOVER <NOISE> PROBES
4ajc0312 CRITICS SAY THAT UNDER HIS CAUTIOUS APPROACH THE F. B. I. FAILED TO DEFEND ITSELF QUICKLY ENOUGH AGAINST RECENT ALLEGATIONS OF POLITICALLY MOTIVATED INVESTIGATIONS
4ajc031a RECENT COVERAGE OF THE CLOSING OF LONG ISLAND LIGHTING COMPANY'S NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BRINGS TO LIGHT A FASCINATING IRONY
4ajc0404 AS THE MARKET CONTINUED ITS UPWARD MARCH IN EARLY JANUARY AN ALREADY MEAGER BEAR POPULATION DWINDLED FURTHER
4ajc0405 IT'S TOUGH TO FIGHT THE TAPE SAYS STANLEY SALVIGSEN THE STILL BEARISH CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT MERRILL LYNCH AND COMPANY
4ajc0406 THE MARKET HAS BEATEN THE BEARS INTO SUBMISSION
4ajc0407 ADDS MICHAEL METZ A MARKET STRATEGIST AT OPPENHEIMER AND COMPANY WHO HAS HIMSELF REMAINED BEARISH THERE'S NOTHING THAT WILL CONVERT A BEAR LIKE AN UP MARKET
4ajc0408 <NOISE> IT MIGHT BE SAID BY WAY OF REJOINDER THAT CONGRESSIONAL LIBERALS WILL BLITHELY ENACT ALL PROPOSED SOCIAL POLICIES <NOISE> THAT ARE POPULAR AND THEN CUT THE MILITARY BUDGET DRASTICALLY
4ajc0409 THIS IS POSSIBLE BUT UNLIKELY <NOISE>
4ajc040a IT IS A LOT EASIER TO FORM A CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY AGAINST DRASTIC CUTS IN DEFENSE THAN AGAINST RELATIVELY MODEST EXPENDITURES ON PARTICULAR SOCIAL PROGRAMS
4ajc040b MAYBE IT IS SUGGESTED THERE IS AN EASIER WAY
4ajc040c WHAT ABOUT FIBERGLAS GONDOLAS <NOISE>
4ajc040d AFTER ALL HE IS REMINDED SOMEBODY IN GERMANY HAS BUILT ONE
4ajc040k IN THE LATEST QUARTER NET INTEREST INCOME MARGINS DECLINED TO FOUR POINT EIGHT SEVEN PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT A YEAR AGO
4ajc040l <NOISE> THE DECLINE REFLECTED LOWER LOAN YIELDS AND REDUCED INVESTMENT INCOME AFTER THE SALE OF HIGH YIELDING BONDS IN LAST YEAR'S FOURTH QUARTER
4ajc040m IT ALSO REFLECTED THE EFFECT OF TAX OVERHAUL WHICH REDUCED THE BENEFITS OF MUNICIPAL AND INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS
4ajc040n FIRST UNION HAS ASSETS OF TWENTY FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
4ajc040o <NOISE> A SPOKESMAN FOR I. M. C. DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE CHARGES
4ajc040p NEITHER OF THE RECAREY BROTHERS NOR MESSRS.
4ajc040q FERNANDEZ AND VILLA DEL REY COULD BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
4ajc040r <NOISE> WE'VE BEEN PONDERING THE SIXTEEN COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT RETURNED AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR DISCONNECTING ODOMETERS ON NEW CARS THAT ITS EMPLOYEES WERE TEST DRIVING
4ajc040s MANY OF THE SOME SIXTY THOUSAND CARS AND TRUCKS WERE DRIVEN FOR UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILES
4akc0201 RICHARD MACDONALD AN ANALYST AT FIRST BOSTON CORPORATION SAID THE RESULTS WERE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS
4akc0202 THE IMPRESSIVE THING IS THE IMPROVEMENTS THEY'VE MADE IN COST SAVINGS HE ADDED
4akc0203 FOR EXAMPLE TIME RECENTLY SAID IT WOULD DO AWAY WITH ITS MAGAZINE DEVELOPMENT GROUP A MOVE MR. MACDONALD SAID COULD SHAVE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL COSTS
4akc020e THE FACILITIES ARE IN BEVERLY AND DANVERS MASSACHUSETTS AND IN CHESHIRE CONNECTICUT
4akc020f HEALTH AND REHABILITATION IS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST
4akc020g CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS BASED GREENERY WHICH OWNS NINE POINT NINE PERCENT OF THE TRUST OPERATES NURSING HOMES
4akc020x ACTION FOR CHILDREN'S TELEVISION IS THE LEAD PARTY IN THE PETITION EVEN THOUGH THE F. C. C. SAID ITS TOUGHER POLICY IS AIMED AT PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM INDECENT FARE
4akc020y VIOLATING FREEDOM OF SPEECH ISN'T THE WAY TO PROTECT CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY
4akc020z IT'S LIKE BURNING BOOKS IN A LIBRARY SAID PEGGY CHARREN PRESIDENT OF THE CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS BASED ORGANIZATION
4akc021e ANALYSTS SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF REASONS WHY THE I. P. O.S ON ONE MARKET MIGHT OUTPERFORM THOSE ON ANOTHER OVER A PARTICULAR PERIOD
4akc021f FOR ONE THING SMALLER STOCKS HAVE OUTPERFORMED LARGER ISSUES FOR MUCH OF THE SPAN COVERED IN N. A. S. D.'S STATISTICS
4akc021g SO THAT PROBABLY HELPED THE NEW ISSUES ON THE O. T. C. MARKET WHICH ARE GENERALLY SMALLER THAN THOSE HEADED FOR THE BIG BOARD
4akc030h DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS
4akc030i THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE
4akc030j TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICK UP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS
4akc030k IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO GET THESE POLICY CHANGES WITHOUT THE CHAOS OF A DECLINING MARKET SAYS HARVARD ECONOMIST LAWRENCE SUMMERS
4akc030l BUT IF THE MARKET GETS PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ANYWAY IT MIGHT HELP
4akc030m TO BE SURE THE STOCK CRASH DOES RAISE THE RISK OF RECESSION
4akc030n THE BENEFITS MENTIONED ABOVE WILL BE OVERWHELMED IF CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES ARE BADLY SHAKEN AND DECIDE TO SHARPLY REDUCE THEIR SPENDING
4akc030o AN UNUSUALLY WEAK CHRISTMAS BUYING SEASON OR WIDESPREAD SHELVING OF BUSINESS INVESTMENT PLANS COULD EASILY CAUSE THE MARKET'S PROBLEMS TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY
4akc030p WHETHER THAT HAPPENS DEPENDS FAR MORE ON PSYCHOLOGY THAN ECONOMICS
4akc0401 MR. KINNEAR CONCEDES THAT TEXACO IS BEING BATTERED BY ITS PENNZOIL DIFFICULTIES
4akc0402 LEGAL EXPENSES ARE MONSTROUS
4akc0403 FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY IS REDUCED TO THE POINT WHERE TEXACO CAN'T FIX A MAJOR WEAKNESS DWINDLING OIL RESERVES
4akc0404 THE COMPANY HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET GOING AND ENDURES INCREASED BORROWING COSTS MR. KINNEAR SAYS
4akc0405 MAJOR BANKS THAT ONCE WERE EAGER TO DO BUSINESS NOW AREN'T
4akc0406 TO RAISE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR INSTANCE THE STOCK OF SOME SUBSIDIARIES HAS BEEN PLEDGED TO BANKS
4akc0407 BUT IF TEXACO SPENDS THAT MONEY BANK LIENS AUTOMATICALLY WILL BE PLACED ON SOME TEXACO ASSETS SAYS RICHARD BRINKMAN CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
4akc040k THE MERGER RESULTS IN SEVERAL CLIENT CONFLICTS
4akc040l PANASONIC COMPANY A BATES CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BACKER HANDLES MAGNAVOX MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID
4akc040m INDUSTRY SOURCES SAY EACH ACCOUNT BILLS CLOSE TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS
4akc040n ALSO HELENE CURTIS LIMITED A BACKER CLIENT IS PLANNING TO LEAVE BECAUSE BATES HANDLES CARTER WALLACE INCORPORATED MR. SPIELVOGEL SAID
4akc040o HELENE CURTIS BILLS ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS EQUAL TO ABOUT HALF OF CARTER WALLACE'S BILLINGS ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES
4akc040v BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT COMPUTERIZED TRADING MAY BE AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK SOME INVESTORS FEAR
4akc040w I'D LOVE FOR ALL THIS STUFF TO JUST GO AWAY
4akc040x BUT IT'S LIKE NUCLEAR ENERGY SAYS JOHN B. CARROLL THE VICE PRESIDENT OF G. T. E. CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT UNIT
4akc040y IT'S THERE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY

4alc0201 MR. KATO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HIS COMPANY'S SHARE PURCHASE PLAN
4alc0202 *MITSUBISHI* SUBSIDIZES ITS EMPLOYEES WHO BUY THE COMPANY'S SHARES BY PAYING TEN PERCENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE
4alc0203 HE FIGURES THAT HE GETS A MUCH BETTER RETURN THAT WAY THAN BY PUTTING MONEY IN THE BANK
4alc0207 JUST WHAT SHUWA HAS IN MIND ISN'T CLEAR
4alc0208 A SPOKESMAN IN THE UNITED STATES SAYS THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THE SALES OF UNITED STATES PROPERTIES BOTH SHUWA'S AND THOSE OWNED BY OTHERS
4alc0209 SHUWA SAYS IT ISN'T AIMING TO SELL TO INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS BUT TO INSTITUTIONS AND LARGE INVESTORS
4alc020a STILL THE SALES OFFICE IS UNUSUAL FOR INSTITUTIONAL BUSINESS MOREOVER IT WILL BE ON THE GINZA AN ADDRESS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL SHOPPING
4alc020o AS PRESIDENT TO A LARGE EXTENT I'LL BE DOING MUCH OF WHAT I DID BEFORE
4alc020p THE COMPANY'S GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE FUELED BY ACQUISITIONS
4alc020q THERE ARE MANY AREAS GEOGRAPHICALLY AND IN THE SKILL CATEGORIES THAT WE LACK HE SAID
4alc020r HE SAID AREAS HE HOPES TO FILL IN INCLUDE A FINANCIAL PUBLIC RELATIONS COMPANY IN NEW YORK AND ACQUISITIONS IN THE MIDWEST
4alc020s I CURRENTLY HAVE TWENTY SIX CONVERSATIONS IN PROGRESS ALTHOUGH I CAN'T GUESS HOW MANY WILL PAN OUT HE SAID
4alc0219 THE OPERATION WAS A PIRATE
4alc021a THEY HAD OPENED WITHOUT OUR BLESSING SAYS ROBERT EARL PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OPERATIONS
4alc021b WE BROUGHT IN OUR DISCIPLINE AND NOW IT'S DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL
4alc021c MR. EARL NOTES THAT THE HARD ROCK IN TOKYO HAS A LARGE KING KONG FIGURE ON THE SIDE OF ITS BUILDING AND DRAWS MOSTLY AMERICANS
4alc0306 BUT THERE APPEAR TO BE SOME MAJOR CATCHES
4alc0307 MANY BANKS THAT CUT RATES HAVE SMALL NUMBERS OF CARDS OUTSTANDING
4alc0308 IN OTHER CASES LOWER RATES ARE AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE MOST CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS
4alc0309 AND CERTAIN RATE REDUCTIONS ARE BEING OFFSET BY HIGHER ANNUAL FEES AND ELIMINATION OF INTEREST FREE GRACE PERIODS
4alc030a NOW THE TWO UNITS ARE FOR SALE FOR FIFTY THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS MAYBE HALF THEIR PEAK VALUES OF THREE YEARS AGO
4alc030b I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP THEM HE SAYS
4alc030c THE TAX LAWS HAVE CHANGED OUT FROM UNDER ME
4alc030p INSTEAD OF SIMPLY SHOWING THE HOMES OF WEALTHY PEOPLE THE NEW H. G. SHOWS WEALTHY PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES
4alc030q IN THE OLD MAGAZINE EVERYTHING WAS SMOOTH NEAT AND TIDY SAID MS. WINTOUR
4alc030r IT WAS AS IF NO ONE LIVED THERE
4alc030s NOW THE FOCUS WILL BE LESS ON THE EMPTY ROOM AND MORE ON THE PERSONALITY BEHIND IT
4alc030w SHORTLY AFTERWARD <NOISE> N. B. C. SAID IT WOULDN'T MOVE TO THE TRUMP SITE
4alc030x HENRY *KANEGSBERG* AN OFFICIAL OF THE GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY UNIT CITED COMMUNITY FERVOR AS A BIG REASON
4alc030y I LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE AND WE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON THERE HE SAID
4alc030z THE RESISTANCE IS LIKELY TO USE MORE CONVENTIONAL WARFARE
4alc0310 IT MAY TRY TO SEIZE STRONGHOLDS <NOISE> WHILE ALSO RELYING ON INSIDE AGENTS TO KILL OFFICIALS IN THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT AND ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICE THE KHAD
4alc0311 THE AIM WOULD BE TO DEMORALIZE OFFICIALS AND FORCE THEM INTO EXILE
4alc0318 UNISYS PLACED SIX EMPLOYEES ON LEAVE WHILE THEY ARE BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE PENTAGON PROCUREMENT SCANDAL
4alc0319 THE COMPUTER COMPANY ALSO TIGHTENED MANAGEMENT CONTROL OVER ITS USE OF CONSULTANTS
4alc031a SEPARATELY UNISYS DISCLOSED TWO MORE FEDERAL INQUIRIES INTO ITS DEFENSE BUSINESS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE SCANDAL
4alc031b WHERE DO YOU GO AROUND HERE TO HAVE A GOOD CRY SAID THE LIKABLE SEEMINGLY THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE PRESS TENT AFTERWARD
4alc031c CHOKING BACK SOBS HE REMARKED IT'S ONLY A GAME RIGHT
4alc031d WHEN ASKED HE SAID THAT EVEN THE OUTLET OF GOING HOME AND KICKING HIS DOG WASN'T AVAILABLE
4alc031e MY DOG'S JUST EIGHT WEEKS OLD HE EXPLAINED
4alc0405 ME AND THE GUY I WAS WITH WERE FISHING ALONG SOME WEEDS NOT GETTING MUCH OF ANYTHING COOK RECALLS
4alc0406 I HOOKED A BIG ONE AND IT GOT AWAY
4alc0407 I THOUGHT UH OH THAT'S IT FOR ME TODAY
4alc0408 COUPLE MINUTES LATER THE EIGHT POUNDER HIT
4alc0409 JUST LUCKY I GUESS
4alc040a THE COMPANY WENT PUBLIC IN NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT
4alc040b MR. DAVIS DIED IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO AT A VERY YOUNG AGE THE ORPHAN WAS THRUST INTO A CRUEL WORLD MR. COBB TOLD THE HARVARD CLUB
4alc040c CONTROL OF THE COMPANY PASSED TO PENN CENTRAL CORP.
4alc040d THE RAILROAD WENT BANKRUPT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY AND IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO IT HIRED MR. COBB TO RUN ARVIDA
4alc040h THE AGENCY SAID IN AN ORDER THAT THE STAFF RECOMMENDED ON AUGUST TWENTIETH THAT THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR SALE BE APPROVED
4alc040i BUT THE F. C. C. SAID IT WANTS TO REVIEW THE RECOMMENDATION AND HALTED THE SALE UNTIL IT CONCLUDES THAT REVIEW
4alc040j THE AGENCY DIDN'T SAY IN THE ORDER WHEN IT EXPECTS TO RULE BUT AN AGENCY SPOKESMAN SAID THAT A DECISION IS LIKELY WITHIN A MONTH
4alc040m EVEN THOUGH INTEL WAS THE FIRST MANUFACTURER OF SUCH DEVICES WE ALONG WITH MOST OTHER UNITED STATES MANUFACTURERS STOPPED MAKING THEM YEARS AGO
4alc040n TODAY A UNITED STATES DRAM IS PRACTICALLY AN *EXTINCT* SPECIES
4alc040r THE COMPANIES SAID THEIR STRENGTHS ARE COMPLEMENTARY
4alc040s VAN KASPER CONCENTRATES ON GROWTH COMPANIES AND BIRR WILSON FOCUSES ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES
4alc040t THE COMBINED OPERATION WILL SERVE MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS
4alc040z MR. MORELAND WHO IS NOW WORKING THROUGH A COMPANY CALLED CONTINENTAL TRADING INTERNATIONAL LIMITED COULDN'T BE REACHED FOR COMMENT
4alc0410 CONTINENTAL'S ATTORNEY JAMES BARBER AND MICHAEL GABRIEL AN ATTORNEY FOR MR. MORELAND VIGOROUSLY DENY ANY FRAUD ON THE PART OF CONTINENTAL OR MORELAND INDUSTRIES

4alc0415 TRI STATE MOTOR TRANSIT SURGED ONE A- AND ONE HALF TO SIXTEEN AND SEVEN EIGHTHS
4alc0416 A GROUP INCLUDING CORSAIR PARTNERS AND CONCORD FINANCIAL GROUP WHICH RAISED ITS STAKE IN THE COMPANY TO ELEVEN POINT TWENTY SIX PERCENT IS PRESSURING THE COMPANY TO RESTRUCTURE
4alc0417 OTHERWISE THE GROUP SAID IT MAY SEEK CONTROL OF THE COMPANY
4alc041b <NOISE> THE F. A. A. ALSO CITED NORTHWEST FOR USING REPAIR PROCEDURES ON ITS SEVEN FORTY SEVENS THAT THE AIRCRAFT'S MANUFACTURER BOEING COMPANY HADN'T APPROVED
4amc0201 ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT TOYOTA WILL SUPPLY VOLKSWAGEN WITH NECESSARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND PARTS FOR PRODUCTION
4amc0202 LOCAL CONTENT IS TARGETED TO EXCEED FIFTY PERCENT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BUT BOTH COMPANIES WILL TRY TO BOOST THAT RATIO EVEN FURTHER
4amc0203 AT LEAST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PARTS HAVE TO BE MADE WITHIN THE E. C. FOR MOTOR VEHICLES TO BE MARKETED IN THE REGION WITHOUT TARIFFS
4amc0204 MR. MEESE ANNOUNCED THAT THE DIVERSION WAS UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS
4amc0205 THE CORRECT FIGURE TURNED OUT TO BE ABOUT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BUT THIS WAS A COMPARATIVELY SMALL MISTAKE
4amc0206 THE BIG PROBLEM WAS THAT IN ITS HASTE TO RUSH THE STORY OUT THE WHITE HOUSE NEVER THOUGHT THROUGH ITS OWN POLITICAL LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION <NOISE>
4amc0207 OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION HAD MADE MISTAKES AND NOW HAD TO GET THE STORY OUT
4amc0208 <NOISE> BUT IT DIDN'T NEED TO ROLL OVER
4amc0209 FOLLOWING THE BASIC LINE WORKED OUT AT THE WHITE HOUSE MR. MEESE USED THE NEWS CONFERENCE TO PORTRAY OLLIE NORTH AS RASPUTIN <NOISE> TO A HAPLESS PRESIDENT

4amc0210 <NOISE> BROWNING FERRIS HAS HAD ITS SHARE OF PROBLEMS WITH REGULATORY AGENCIES
4amc0211 IT TOOK THE COMPANY MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS TO ACQUIRE PERMITS FOR A WASTE FACILITY NOW BEING BUILT IN RURAL COLORADO
4amc0212 MR. RUCKELSHAUS CAUTIONED THAT HE ISN'T SURE HE CAN SPEED UP SUCH EFFORTS
4amc0213 <NOISE> I DON'T HAVE ANY MAGIC FORMULA
4amc0214 <NOISE> BUT HE SAID HE WILL ATTEND SOME LA- LOCAL MEETINGS WHERE RESIDENTS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DISCUSS ISSUING PERMITS
4amc0215 I THINK I CAN SET A TONE FOR HOW OUR EMPLOYEES RELATE TO CASH ISSUES HE SAID
4amc0305 PRICES AROUND HERE ARE WHERE THEY WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SAYS NANCY ERICKSON A REAL ESTATE AGENT
4amc030m THE PUZZLE FOR THE DEMOCRATS IS THAT THEIR PROCESS DOESN'T WINNOW VERY FAST
4amc030n THEY BEGAN WITH EIGHT CANDIDATES
4amc030o THEY STILL HAVE FIVE
4amc030u AFTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS IT SAYS
4amc030w <NOISE> AFTER ONE HOUR EIGHTEEN MINUTES BOASTS THE AD

4amc040c B. O. C. EXPECTS THE NEW PLANT TO BRING IT REVENUE OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS
4amc040v <NOISE> BEHIND THE CHAIRMANSHIP SPECULATION IS A GREATER DEBATE ABOUT MR. JOHNSON
4amc040w IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY PEOPLE ARE LABELED BY THEIR TRAINING
4amc040x ROGER SMITH IS AS G. M.'S TOP EXECUTIVE TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN A FINANCE GUY
4amc040y SOME CRITICS SAY THAT THIS IS EMBLEMATIC OF THE AUTO MAKER'S PROBLEMS AND THAT A PRODUCT GUY SHOULD RUN THE COMPANY
4amc040z <NOISE> DOES G. M. THEY ASK REALLY NEED A LEGAL GUY
4amc0410 <NOISE> MR. JOHNSON'S SUPPORTERS RESPOND THAT MANAGEMENT QUALIFICATIONS ARE AS IMPORTANT AS AUTOMOTIVE EXPERTISE
4amc0411 STILL DAIMLER EXECUTIVES HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN THEIR NEW CHAIRMAN SOMETHING THEY NEVER HAD IN MR. BREITSCHWERDT
4amc0412 THINGS ARE MOVING AHEAD AGAIN SAYS ONE PLANT MANAGER

4anc0204 RICHARD NIXON WAS A PRESIDENT OF MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS TOO LITTLE REMEMBERED
4anc0205 WATERGATE CAME TO DESTROY HIM LARGELY BECAUSE HE LEFT THE ACTIONS OF SUBORDINATES TOO LITTLE WATCHED
4anc0206 <NOISE> THEN HE MADE A MISTAKE CHURCHILL NEVER DID TRYING OUT OF MISTAKEN LOYALTY TO PROTECT THOSE SUBORDINATES FROM THEIR OWN BLUNDERS
4anc020j ONE CLOUD LOOMS HOWEVER
4anc020k BRITAIN'S CURRENT ACCOUNT WHICH MEASURES TRADE IN GOODS SERVICES AND CERTAIN OTHER UNILATERAL TRANSFERS IS MOVING STEADILY INTO THE RED
4anc020l IN THE PAST PAYMENTS IMBALANCES HAVE TRIGGERED CURRENCY CRISES IN BRITAIN
4anc020m <NOISE> ANALYSTS PREDICT THAT THE POUND COULD COME UNDER PRESSURE NEXT YEAR AS THE DEFICIT WIDENS
4anc0216 SHULTZ SAID TALKS INTENDED TO INDUCE THE MILITARY LEADER TO LEAVE PANAMA HAD COLLAPSED BECAUSE NORIEGA WOULDN'T CARRY THROUGH WITH THE OFFER WORKED OUT BY HIS NEGOTIATORS

4anc0218 UNDER THE DEAL THE U. S. OFFERED TO DROP DRUG CHARGES AGAINST NORIEGA IN RETURN FOR HIS DEPARTURE
4anc0219 SHULTZ SAID THE U. S. WOULD WORK THROUGH OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET NORIEGA OUT OF POWER
4anc0304 AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH COMPETITION HAS BEEN RESTRICTED ENOUGH SO THAT OVERALL FARES HAVE RISEN IN RECENT MONTHS
4anc0305 CUT RATE FARES WILL CARRY MORE RESTRICTIONS THAN EVER SOME TICKETS FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE NON REFUNDABLE
4anc0306 AND IN CITIES WITH DRASTICALLY REDUCED COMPETITION SUCH AS DETROIT MINNEAPOLIS AND SAINT LOUIS ANY DISCOUNTS MAY BE HARD TO FIND
4anc0307 MR.
4anc0308 <NOISE> TAFT IS FORCING THE ISSUE SAID PETER APPERT A BROADCASTING SECURITIES ANALYST AT CYRUS J. LAWRENCE INCORPORATED IN NEW YORK

4aoc0201 THIS IS A YEAR END PHENOMENON CAUSED MOSTLY BY GERMAN *AUSTERITY* ONE FRENCH OFFICIAL SAID
4aoc0202 THE MARK HAS BEEN STRONG AGAINST MOST EUROPEAN CURRENCIES NOT JUST AGAINST THE FRANC
4aoc0203 WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THINGS WILL SETTLE DOWN DURING THE NEW YEAR
4aoc0204 WE DON'T SEE ANY NEED FOR A REALIGNMENT
4aoc020g SPERRY AND HUTCHINSON COMPANY IS TESTING THE CONCEPT AT FRANK'S SUPERMARKETS IN CONNECTICUT USING A MAGNETIC CARD
4aoc020h EACH CARD HOLDS ABOUT TEN BOOKS OF STAMPS
4aoc020s AMONG ITS REASONS PROVIGO'S BOARD CITED THE FACT THAT *UNIGESCO* AND EMPIRE ARE ALREADY PROVIGO'S MAIN SHAREHOLDERS AND SAID THE OFFER WON'T CHANGE THEIR EFFECTIVE CONTROL
4aoc020t PROVIGO ALSO SAID HOLDERS WHO DON'T ACCEPT THE OFFER STILL WILL BE ABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET
4aoc020u <NOISE> THE BOARD CONCLUDED THAT WHETHER OR NOT A HOLDER ACCEPTS THE OFFER IS A PERSONAL INVESTMENT DECISION
4aoc0301 THE LATEST RESULTS INDICATE THE TOLL THAT DECLINING HOSPITAL USE IS TAKING ON HUMANA EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY HAS MOVED TO CUT COSTS
4aoc0302 <NOISE> A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE LENGTH OF STAY BY HOSPITAL PATIENTS WASN'T ENOUGH TO FULLY OFFSET A FOUR POINT THREE PERCENT DECLINE IN ADMISSIONS

4aoc030c G. E. ALSO NAMED THE FOLLOWING *KIDDER* DIRECTORS
4aoc030d ANY GOVERNMENT BAILOUT POSES SEVERAL RISKS
4aoc030e ONE IS <NOISE> THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY UPSET THE INDUSTRY'S COMPETITIVE BALANCE
4aoc030f <NOISE> WHILE BIG UNIONIZED STEELMAKERS ARE STUMBLING MINIMILLS SMALL PLANTS THAT MAKE STEEL FROM SCRAP INSTEAD OF IRON ORE ARE FLOURISHING
4aoc030g BY RESCUING THE BIG STEELMAKERS SOME ECONOMISTS SAY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD *IMPLICITLY* SAY IT'S WRONG FOR MARKET FORCES TO WORK
4aoc030n IN INTERVIEWS AND SPEECHES MR. ROH HAS SHOWN A GOOD GRASP OF THE ISSUES KOREA'S NEXT PRESIDENT FACES
4aoc030o HE TAKES NORTH KOREA FOR THE SERIOUS THREAT THAT IT IS
4aoc030p NATIONAL SECURITY IS A BIG CONCERN FOR SOUTH KOREANS AND IF THEY THINK MR. ROH CAN BEST PROVIDE IT THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR HIM

4aoc030w MANY ECONOMISTS BELIEVE THAT AT THE VERY LEAST THE UNDERLYING TREND CONTINUES TO CALL FOR GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT
4aoc030x BUT THE BIGGEST STUMBLING BLOCK MAY BE THE MANAGERS THEMSELVES
4aoc030y MANY OF THEM CAN'T HANDLE CRITICISM FROM SUBORDINATES
4aoc030z IN FACT EVEN PROPONENTS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MANY MANAGERS WHO RECEIVE APPRAISALS JUST SHOVE THE RESULTS IN A DRAWER
4aoc0319 NONE OF THIS MEANS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT
4aoc031a <NOISE> CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A L- STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP
4aoc031b THERE MAY BE A GROWING JAPANESE SELF CONFIDENCE IN JAPAN BUT THERE ARE RELATIVELY F:EW JAPANESE ENTREPRENEURS
4aoc031c THERE MAY BE SCA:DS OF MONEY IN JAPAN BUT THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL

4arc040k I DID POLL ON THE FAIRNESS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO JUDGE BORK AND A FIFTY SIX PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT MAJORITY THOUGHT THE COMMITTEE HAD BEEN FAIR

4asc0413 BUT THE U. S. HAS THE RIGHT AND THE POWER TO STOP GENERAL NORIEGA'S AGGRESSION AGAINST ITS YOUTH AND INNER CITIES
4asc0415 THE GROUP HERE IN LIBERTY CENTER WAS RECRUITED BY A FARMER WHO PROMISED WORK FOR THREE MONTHS
4asc0416 WITH THE PROMISE NOW MEANINGLESS THE BAND HAS TAKEN REFUGE AT THE MIGRANT REST CENTER BEYOND THE USUAL THREE DAY LIMIT

4atc0303 ACCESS WILL BE BY A SINGLE DOUBLE DECKER BRIDGE FOR CARS AND TRAINS MAKING THE AIRPORT VULNERABLE TO CIVIC UNREST OF THE KIND THAT HAS PLAGUED NARITA
